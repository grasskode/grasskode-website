&lt;p&gt;My rating: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1098253729&#34;&gt;3 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t quite remember how I had come across this book but I think it was through a reference in another. Anyway, the title was quite interesting and I picked it bought it in my kindle library. I picked it up while I was backpacking and while I had intended to complete the book in the duration, it was not to be so. The thing about e-readers is that it is difficult to gauge how long or short the book is. Plus, I think that the e-reader takes some of the joy away from reading for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first Robert Musil and I had little to expect from the book. My liking for the book went through some muddled phases as the book progressed. The story in itself was nothing that kept me bound to the book. Indeed, my reading pattern was of a stolen half hour every day and at times I used to be too busy to pick up the book for days at length. However, there was a familiarity with which I returned to the book. It was as if I was hanging out with people I knew. Which talks a lot about the characters that the author has built in this story. There is not much of a story though and the pages go through one idea after another, at times leaving little breathing space in between so that the entire process seems too tedious and long drawn. The book&amp;rsquo;s being unfinished does not affect the reader so much since there was nothing in the story that begged conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story in itself is about a man, Ulrich, who serves as the protagonist. He is the man in question, the man without qualities, or rather, a man without any specific quality. The story is set in Austria in the dying days of the monarchy and moves through the upper circles of the society. Ulrich is put into a circle of politically and intellectually inclined people, some of whom take a liking to him and take him under their patronage. While he tussles intellectually with his new group of friends, the rest of his life sees action as well. His old friends, his mistress, his father&amp;rsquo;s death and the surprise reunion with his sister, all add individual elements to this potpourri of stories and ideas with no specific theme. The book finishes abruptly in one of those social gatherings that form the crux of the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing I liked about Musil&amp;rsquo;s writing is that he built extremely strong characters. So strong in fact that you start befriending them while you go through this book. However, reading the story was like putting up with the intellectual bullshitting of these friends. There were times when I had to read pages without interest, through some verbose explanation of some idea that I could not empathise with. This will remain my only Musil for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My rating: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1808227893&#34;&gt;4 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent cleaning exercise, out of the recesses of old bookshelves, came out this beauty. It had been a while since I had taken up a paperback and my current read, &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/527756.The_Man_Without_Qualities&#34;&gt;The Man Without Qualities&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; seemed to be going nowhere. Since this seemed like a book that I could be done with a a few days, I decided to make it an interim read. I had been meaning to read Hesse for a long time. My copy of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16631.Steppenwolf&#34;&gt;Steppenwolf&lt;/a&gt; lies forgotten in some cupboard or the other back home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hermann Hesse is rightly considered one of the greatest writers of his time. &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32073688-demian&#34;&gt;Demian&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; is considered one of those novels that struck a resonating note with the youth of the post Great War era. Hesse initially published it under a pseudonym and it was only later that it was understood that the work that so many youngsters identified with was by a man in his forties. Such empathy and connection with his audience is probably what makes Hesse&amp;rsquo;s work so engaging. In &amp;ldquo;Demian&amp;rdquo; he explores the world of the sub-conscious and the exploration of the supernatural powers in individuals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book revolves around Emil Sinclair (this was the pseudonym that Hesse used to publish the book initially), from the time he was a little boy, till he lay wounded as a soldier in the Great War. Sinclair goes through the pangs of growing up and finding out that the world consists of the light and the dark. He is rescued from boyhood difficulties by a new schoolmate, Max Demian, and looks up to this young man for inspiration and knowledge. After school their ways part and Sinclair finds out his own way in life which incidentally leads him back to Demian and his strange world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hermann Hesse has me interested. While the story of Demian was not too elaborate, it is the protagonist&amp;rsquo;s journey through the various stages of youth that clearly expresses the author&amp;rsquo;s genius. The way he is able to empathise with feelings of a boy so young, and moreover, able to express it in a way that the reader feels the sorrows and joys of growing up, is something that I found extremely captivating. I definitely intend to read more of him. A friend had recently recommended me &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52036.Siddhartha&#34;&gt;Siddhartha&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; and I might take it up sometime soon. Also, I am thinking of going back to paperback whenever I can!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My rating: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1079709095&#34;&gt;3 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was advised about reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/8120306872/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3626&amp;creative=24790&amp;creativeASIN=8120306872&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=readings0c-21&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Philosophy of Religion&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; by an uncle of mine as a response to another &lt;a href=&#34;http://fleetingnonsense.blogspot.com/2014/10/of-religion-and-science.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;. I had put it on my reading list and even got myself a copy but the dry schoolbook-like text had put me off the task of reading it for quite a while. Eventually I did get to it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book starts of in a rather dry fashion, but you need to remember that this is primarily an academic text. The author goes into great detail about the concept of God as seen in the Judaic-Christian way. Then he expounds on multiple theories that have been proposed to support and to deny the existence of such a being. It was on limited interest to me because I belonged to a household of different faith before turning agnostic. But it did shed some very interesting light on the way that human beings tend to see God. Towards the end the book did get more interesting when it got to the concept of religion and the various contradictory claims by the many religions in the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book is in no way exhaustive and I do not suppose any book can ever be comprehensive on such a varied and evolving subject. But I felt that the book was primarily designed for the followers of Christian faith in order to understand their religion and God better. In parts it was interesting but overall a rather dry book. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s use is limited to the academia.&lt;/p&gt;
