      <description>I had put in my papers earlier this year and took off work in May. The idea was (and still is) to explore the alternation as a way of life. I find it hard to do things half-heartedly so I give it my all when I am in a job, consequently burn myself and then I think I owe myself some time off in order to explore other things in life and to help myself see a grander perspective.</description>

      <description>While foreigners require special permits to visit certain protected areas in India, the domestic tourists also require an ILP in certain regions, not necessarily the same. Here is a short account of these requirements in North East India.
What are Inner Line Permits? Think of them as a visa that you require to travel within your country. ðŸ˜¬
Started by the Britishers (like most other nuisances), the ILP is a document that limits the stay of an Indian citizen in a &amp;ldquo;protected area&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Ziro is not a music festival it is an experience
 A line we heard over and over by countless number of people. I will set a little background first. The only music festivals Karan and I have been to are NH7 and Supersonic and since we were based out of Pune these were not exactly &amp;ldquo;Outdoor Music Festivals&amp;rdquo;. So whenever someone said the above mentioned line I could only wonder what is so different.</description>

      <description>Almost a month into our north-eastern romance, Parul and I were on our way to Meghalaya. This leg had required some planning and coordination since there were more than two jobless people involved. So after Tawang, Parul and I headed to Guwahati to be hosted by an amazing warm family (more on that later) and to meet Aamir and Neha, who were flying in from Pune to join us for Meghalaya.</description>
