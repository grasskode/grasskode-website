&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://grasskode.xyz/post/travel/sea-cambodia-preahvihear/&#34;&gt;Preah Vihear trip&lt;/a&gt; had been, what is probably, the defining experience of my Cambodian travel. The temple was breathtaking and it would end up stealing the glamour from the famed Angkor temples of Siem Reap. However, that was the town I was headed to next, to see the temples and begin the ending of my South East Asian adventures. I was also going to meet up with some old friends which I was &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; looking forward to!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;experiencing-siem-reap&#34;&gt;Experiencing Siem Reap&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting to Siem Reap meant taking another minivan. The minivans from Preah Vihear left early in the morning and I asked the hotel to arrange for one. The journey was almost 7 hours long and an adventure as always. The Cambodian minivan really does test limits of transportation. They stuff in just about anything, from humans to motorbikes and furnitures! I lost my seat when, sometime on the way, the rear half of the van was collapsed to make room for two huge wooden chairs. It was fun though!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Cambodian minivans never disappoint!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Siem Reap is a quaint town with a stream flowing through it. Most of the tourist area is concentrated in a 500m by 500m area around this stream. I was making my way to the far end of this area, to a hostel that Eitan had suggested. As before, his suggestion turned out to be quite nice and I took up a bed in the huge dorm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was meeting up with old friends in Siem Reap but I had gotten here early. So I had a few days to kill before it would be time to do proper touristy stuff (read, the Angkor Temples). At first I was at a loss as to what I would do all these days and contemplated a short trip to Battambang. However, it turned out that Siem Reap had much to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did was to check out the nightlife in the city. I was handed out a flyer for the &lt;em&gt;Siem Reap Pub Crawl&lt;/em&gt; while walking down the famous &lt;strong&gt;Pub Street&lt;/strong&gt; and I thought it would be a nice way to get acquainted with the city&amp;rsquo;s nightlife. Plus, it would have been a great place to make new friends. So I joined the pub crawl that night and it turned out to be amazing fun!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;VIDEO : Siem Reap Nightlife&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a few new friends that night and they turned out to be a real fun batch. We met the next night as well and danced till the wee hours of the night. Siem Reap is one place where you will never fall short of options to party! Amazing clubs, cheap beer and good music. I really liked how the crowd spills over to the streets and starts dancing there itself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Drink up!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hostel was a nice place to chill out as well. They had a swimming pool that I made good use of to lounge around. We had some unexpected guests one evening when a horde of children invaded the pool to the amusement of everyone present. I tried asking their guardian if the kids were from some school but she was not so good at English. Instead, she handed me some local savouries and smiled as I gobbled them up. üçÆ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did some walking around the city as well. I went to random pagodas in the town, checked out some cheap eateries for daily food and discovered a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d4587137-Reviews-Bloom_Cafe_and_Training_Centre-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html&#34;&gt;great cafe&lt;/a&gt; which served delicious cupcakes!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;As delicious as it looks üòã&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the third morning, Arjun and Devashish joined me for another one of our yearly outings. Although I had made plenty of new friends on the road, it is always good to be back in the company of old friends!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2819/33107413312_2c72c9e41d.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;with-the-guys&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Yey!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since they were tired with all the travelling they had to do to get there, we roamed around a bit, lazed by the swimming pool drinking beer and ate crocodile burgers and had ecstatic shakes to kill the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3932/32448779673_4a8cc6b5b8.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ecstatic-pizza&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Local specialty üòÅ&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We figured out a rough itinerary for the following day and called it an early night so that we could begin early the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;angkor-temples&#34;&gt;Angkor Temples&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning we headed out for the Angkor temples on our rented e-bikes. We got a three day pass which we thought would be sufficient to explore the temples. We did manage to cover a decent amount that day despite the frequent showers that delayed our schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/705/32419962504_45d553fcbd.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;e-bikes-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Hipster bikes&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The temples were beautiful and verdant, but I will let the pictures do most of the explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are way more pictures of the temples that I clicked. You can find them in the album at the end of the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Banteay Kdei&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were armed with a map and a route recommended by the guy who had sold us the e-bikes. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banteay_Kdei&#34;&gt;Banteay Kdei&lt;/a&gt; was first of the many temples we saw that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Ruins&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Directionless&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ta Prohm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next stop was &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta_Prohm&#34;&gt;Ta Phrom&lt;/a&gt;, which was made famous by the movie &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lara_Croft:_Tomb_Raider&#34;&gt;Lara Croft : Tomb Raider&lt;/a&gt;. The temple&amp;rsquo;s renovation was being supported by the Indian government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Restored temples&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ta Keo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta_Keo&#34;&gt;Ta Keo&lt;/a&gt; is aptly named the mountain temple. It rises quite abruptly and the stairs were a steep climb up. Arjun had &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; difficulty finding his footing. üòÖ Ta Keo&amp;rsquo;s restoration was being supported by the Chinese government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Standing tall&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thommanon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thommanon&#34;&gt;Thommanon&lt;/a&gt; is a pair of temples that were relatively free of the tourist rush. We stopped here for a bit and attempted some &amp;ldquo;Temple Run&amp;rdquo; photography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bayon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayon&#34;&gt;Bayon&lt;/a&gt; is probably one of the best known Angkor temples after Angkor Wat. This temple is famous for the towers with smiling faces. Contrary to how I had imagined, the faced did not look that creepy! Although the pictures barely do justice to the overwhelming presence of &lt;em&gt;Avlokiteshvara&lt;/em&gt; all around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Siem Reap Tip #1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Angkor temples are spread across a huge area with random temples sprawling throughout. There are many small temples that pop up here and there and then, of course, there are the more famous ones. If you are not a super history buff or an archaeologist or a specialist of some kind, do not aspire to do them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3892/32880521900_03033429ba.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;map&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Action plan&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We returned to the city after a tiring day of temple hopping. We had been slowed down considerably by the intermittent rains and the e-bikes were also giving us a little trouble. So we returned the bikes and asked a random &lt;em&gt;tuk-tuk&lt;/em&gt; driver if he would take us around the next morning. It turned out to be less of a hassle than we had imagined and we had a sealed deal in a couple of minutes. Our &lt;em&gt;tuk-tuk&lt;/em&gt; driver told us to be ready at a sharp 5:30 AM so we called in another early night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-temples&#34;&gt;More Temples&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early mornings are always painful. Our first destination was the famous Angkor Wat temple which people flock to before sunrise to get a picture of the temple against the background of the rising sun. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dawn_at_the_temple_Ankor_Wat_at_sunrise,_Siem_Reap,_Cambodia.jpg&#34;&gt;pictures over the internet&lt;/a&gt; had me believing that the temple stood behind a vast pond, but it turned out that those pictures were shot in front of nothing more than a stagnant pool of water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/602/33107400182_b24d514df1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;angkor-wat-sunrise-crowd-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;The meh moment&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Angkor Wat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkor_Wat&#34;&gt;Angkor Wat&lt;/a&gt; though, is massive and flanked by an equally massive moat, making it the biggest religious monument in the world! It is well maintained as well with a near complete restoration work. My epitome temple experience, however, had been &lt;a href=&#34;http://grasskode.xyz/post/travel/sea-cambodia-preahvihear/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preah Vihear&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Angkor Wat did not match up to the hype that surrounds it. Perhaps the swarm of tourists played a role in spoiling the experience. We checked out the temple quickly and made our way out. We were trying to stay ahead of the tourist wave that would spill over from this temple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were at much more ease in a &lt;em&gt;tuk-tuk&lt;/em&gt; and the intermittent showers bothered us less. To top it, our driver was a really nice guy, a rarity in itself! I had initially feared that a &lt;em&gt;tuk-tuk&lt;/em&gt; would rob us of the freedom to stop and explore as we please but it was much more convenient and saved us a lot of time as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Siem Reap Tip #2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a group of two or more, it is much more economical and wise to take a &lt;em&gt;tuk-tuk&lt;/em&gt; to explore the Angkor temple ruins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We saw more temples that day and it would be pointless to get into the details of them. They were, simply put, temples in ruins and various stages of restoration. When you actually see the ruins that these restorations are being attempted from, it seems like an impossible task altogether!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baphuon &amp;amp; Around&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baphuon&#34;&gt;Baphuon&lt;/a&gt; is located inside Angkor Thom and we managed to reach here before the tourist invasion. In fact, we had to wait a few minutes before the gates of the temple were opened by the guard! The restoration here is being supported by the French government. There is a nice walking route that starts at Baphuon and goes around through some more ruins before ending back along the main road at the &lt;strong&gt;Elephant Terrace&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Misfits&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preah Khan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preah_Khan&#34;&gt;Preah Khan&lt;/a&gt; was the temple that made the damage to the Angkor temples the most obvious. There was rubble lying all around waiting to be put back into their appointed place. We made our way through the temple and ended on the other side with an impressive view of the &lt;em&gt;Jayatataka baray&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ta Som &amp;amp; East Mebon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We quickly did two more temples at &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta_Som&#34;&gt;Ta Som&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Mebon&#34;&gt;East Mebon&lt;/a&gt;. These were smaller temples and the tourists had started swarming by then. We did enjoy some sceneries though but the temples were getting repetitive by now.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;East Mebon&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended the second day of temple tours with a trip to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.inklabtattoosiemreap.com/&#34;&gt;the tattoo studio&lt;/a&gt;. I had finalized a Khmer &lt;a href=&#34;https://aryayogi.wordpress.com/2013/01/15/kirtimukha-the-face-of-glory/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;kirtimukha&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Kala) design the previous evening and Bear, my Thai tattoo artist, etched the new tattoo with great expertise on my right arm. It cost me a bomb but on hindsight, it was completely worth it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3927/32448744673_4d778697cf.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;with-bear&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Kala&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent the rest of the evening on the Pub Street as usual. Siem Reap is pretty convenient in this matter. The area around the Pub Street is all that you would need for your touristy needs. You can shop for souvenirs, have the local cuisines, drink cheap beer and cocktails and have a blast; all in a radius of a couple of hundred meters!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Siem Reap Tip #3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do yourself a favour and lay off the scorpion, snake and tarantula. They taste horrible and are &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; not worth the effort! There are better local dishes to try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;even-more-temples&#34;&gt;Even More Temples&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were wiser by day three and started the day at a more amicable hour. We were running out of stamina for all the temple watching and decided to keep the day short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Sleepy sleepy&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Banteay Srei&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first temple of the day, after a rather long ride beyond the Angkor Thom, was &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banteay_Srei&#34;&gt;Banteay Srei&lt;/a&gt;. This temple, in terms of decoration, was much more beautiful than the ones that we had seen till now. The restoration work was much more comprehensive and the temple made for a pleasant walk around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Picture perfect!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kbal Spean&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we were taken to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kbal_Spean&#34;&gt;Kbal Spean&lt;/a&gt;, which is famous as a &lt;em&gt;waterfall&lt;/em&gt;. It is much more than just a waterfall though. The entire riverbed is decorated with motifs and carvings in the stones. However, we did not know this and ended up doing an aimless 3 km hike. Deva and I were loudly discussing software architecture to the apparent displeasure of anyone who happened to cross our way. üòæ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Siem Reap Tip #4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do your homework on the places that you are going to visit. If you can, take a trip to the national museum before heading out to see the temples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Banteay Samre&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended the temple tour with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banteay_Samr%C3%A9&#34;&gt;Banteay Samre&lt;/a&gt;, a relatively empty temple to the east of Angkor Thom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Siem Reap Tip #5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had taken a three day pass for the Angkor temples. However, a continuous marathon of the temples is a tad bit tiring. I would suggest, if you have the time, pocket and patience for it, to spread out the temple visits more evenly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We returned to the town towards the evening and spent a while lazing. We hit the Pub Street with vengeance that night since we did not have to get up early the next morning. Siem Reap is awesome place to spend a short vacation. You have enough to keep you busy throughout the day and the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;choum-reap-lear-cambodia&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choum reap lear&lt;/em&gt;, Cambodia&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reserved the last day for walking through the markets and buying a few things that we wanted to take back with us. Arjun used his awesome bargaining skills to buy paintings for himself and Deva, while I contended myself with knick-knacks that befitted my mode of travelling. We took the day to wind down from all the running about of the last few days. We even joined the pub crawl once again but it was not as good as the one I had been to. The crowd really does make a lot of difference!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Siem Reap Airport&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it was time to head out. Arjun was on his way back to Bangalore to continue his daily grind at work. Deva and I were catching a flight to Bangkok and thence to our next destination where our vacation would continue for another week.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>

&lt;p&gt;I got out of Vung Tau after a few days of relearning the traveller&amp;rsquo;s life. I made a few friends that I could not afford to keep for long. So I set out of the small town with the intent of crossing the border to Cambodia. However, I managed to find a host in Saigon and decided to stay for a couple of days. Despite the few times I had been in the big city, I had seen very little of it and had used it more or less as a pass-through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;surfing-again&#34;&gt;Surfing Again&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left Vung Tau and headed for Saigon. I was in half a mind to exit the country on the same day and spend more time in Cambodia. For some reason I had never felt any charm for the big city in the multiple times I passed through it. I was also running low on my reserve of dongs as well and did not want to make another withdrawal. Just to try my luck, I sent some random messages on couchsurfing and one of the better rated hosts accepted my request! All this happened during my 2 hour transit from Vung Tau to Saigon, so by the time I stepped out of the cab in District One, I had the address of my host and directions of how to get there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I caught a bus from the Ben Thanh bus stop as directed by my host, Phuong. The ride took me a considerable distance off the city&amp;rsquo;s center. I got off in front of the Tr∆∞·ªùng ƒêHSP K·ªπ Thu·∫≠t, the Technical University of Saigon. I walked into one of the lanes to the house number that Phuong had provided me. The house was easy to find but I was left slightly amused when I found myself looking at another English Center!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The receptionist let me in and and Phuong came out of a meeting to tell me that it would take her 30 minutes or so to complete the meeting. I asked her if I could dump my bags somewhere and then told her that I would return in half an hour. I strolled out of the center to look for a cafe and found one a few buildings down from Phuong&amp;rsquo;s place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat in the small cafe reading and sipping on my favourite form of Vietnamese coffee, a &lt;em&gt;Ca Phe Sua Da&lt;/em&gt;. This district seemed to be reasonable as compared to District One. Things were not outrageously expensive and I did not need to think a hundred times before I decided to treat myself to a coffee. Before the thirty minutes were over, however, it started to rain; and it rained like mad! It was so bad that I decided to sit the rains out despite the center being less than fifty meters from where I was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;instagram-media&#34; data-instgrm-version=&#34;7&#34; style=&#34; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;padding:8px;&#34;&gt; &lt;div style=&#34; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&#34;&gt; &lt;div style=&#34; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&#34; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/p/BJmPFoJBYyz/&#34; style=&#34; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;A photo posted by Karan (@grasskode)&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;time style=&#34; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&#34; datetime=&#34;2016-08-27T03:41:46+00:00&#34;&gt;Aug 26, 2016 at 8:41pm PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rains did not stop, however, and I decided to leave after having another smoothie. I got a little wet in the few feet that I had to run in order to get to the center. Phuong was sitting at the reception and we exchanged hellos again. She took me upstairs to show me the room I would be getting. I was to have a big room all to myself! &lt;strong&gt;NICE!&lt;/strong&gt; There was a fan and a mattress; what else could a weary traveller want for? Phuong did not talk much, and I was not sure if it was her nature or whether she was too busy. She just showed me where what was and then left telling me that she would appreciate it if I came down to talk to the students later that evening. I gladly agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinh and I had gotten in touch and had planned to meet later that evening. The rains were proving to be a nuisance though and we postponed the plan for later. The rains would not stop till around 8 in the evening, pouring with intensity for more than three hours! I went downstairs to talk to the students later. It was a pretty nice experience as always. These students were the more advanced ones and I now had the requisite training to talk with patience and understanding. We talked mostly about my travel through Vietnam. Two of the students even offered to accompany me for dinner when I told them I had not had food yet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ate a &lt;em&gt;Bo Kho Hu Tieu&lt;/em&gt; for dinner and talked some more to the two students who had joined me. I asked them about their studies and about life in Saigon. It was true what I had been told earlier. Life outside of District One was much cheaper than in it. This being the university area, it seemed to be really cheap. I bid the guys farewell after dinner and walked back to the center. I sat downstairs a while and talked to Phuong about travel in India; how safe it is for travellers, etc. I have found this a constant apprehension in many females whom I have met. They want to go to India but the news says that it is unsafe for females. I tried to explain as best I could but it is difficult to dispel such reservations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two more girls who were being hosted by Phuong returned from District One telling horror stories about clogged roads and standstill traffic because of the incessant rains. They were surfing in the center as well but I did not get to interact with them. The center was big and comfortable but consequently lacked opportunities to get to know one&amp;rsquo;s fellow surfers. Anyhow, I did some writing and then called it a night. I had some vague plans as to how I would spend the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;up-in-the-air&#34;&gt;Up in the Air&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a bus back to District One the next day. The public bus service in Saigon was proving to be quite convenient. By the time I had reached Ben Thanh Market, Chinh had pinged me and we had arranged to meet for lunch. Chinh was a friend of a friend whom I had met during a trip to Saigon while I was teaching in Dong Nai. Neither of us were aware of any good places in District One so I agreed to meet Chinh near the airport. She was an air-hostess and lived in that area. The war museum that I had planned on seeing was also breaking for lunch so I had something to do rather than wander mindlessly in District One.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit of looking around online led me to a very useful app, &lt;a href=&#34;http://busmap.vn/?locale=en&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BusMap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This app listed all the bus routes and provides easy search facilities to look for options to commute from point A to point B. Using the app, I found a bus route that would take me to the airport and then found the closest bus stop on that route; easy-peasy. To top it off, the bus cost me a mere 5k VND. Upon getting to the airport and meeting Chinh, I told her how awesome I found Saigon&amp;rsquo;s bus service. She had never taken the bus though since she found them hot and crowded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Amazing buses of Saigon&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went to a place that served Bun Dau Mam Tom, a rice noodle and tofu dish with shrimp sauce. Chinh ordered the food and I did the majority of eating! We talked a lot, during the lunch and after it as well. She was having a hard time coping with her flying schedule. She flew to Los Angeles (USA) twice a month and while I had thought flying to LA would be an exciting prospect, she enlightened me to the other side of the story. The life of a flight attendant was not as rosy as I had previously supposed. She also informed me that Nils might be returning to Vietnam for a longer time. That would be something. üòÄ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/6/5816/30241690696_a95987fb0e.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;dau-mam-tom&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Kevin approves of Dau Mam Tom!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinh paid for the lunch despite my insistence and then we sat in the mall next doors for some dessert and coffee. Chinh&amp;rsquo;s friend joined us there and we sat talking about random things. I left a while later; they were school friends with much catching up to do and I had a war museum to visit. I took another bus back towards District one and got off right next to the museum; easy-peasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;forgotten-history&#34;&gt;Forgotten History&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war museum left me in a state of frustration. Along my travels through Vietnam, I had time and again met Americans who, after a few drinks, were willing to talk about the Vietnamese war. I had heard them take various stances; some said that the American government was simply supporting a civil war like in the case of Koreas; some admitted to them going overboard with the bombings; some agreed that the Americans were wrong, but that was the American government, not the people. What I found in the war museum was a tremendous amount of buried history, something that no one was talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My source of knowledge about the Vietnamese war had always been popular media. While I admit that it is not the best of sources for knowledge, I had no idea how biased it all was. My few hours in the museum made me aware of the other side of the story. The Americans had allegedly set up a (questionably) puppet government in southern Vietnam after France&amp;rsquo;s defeat as the coloniser. They had even issued statements that they were protecting their interests in the tin and tungsten available in the region. This is not something difficult to imagine. Imperialism is no longer an unknown strategy now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5541/30276712465_a37b55fd71.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;war-museum-3&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Imperialism&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there were the napalm and phosphorus bombs. And the gruesome &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_Orange&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agent Orange&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Chemical warfare was one of the excuses that the American government had used to invade Iraq. How many remembered that they had committed the same crime themselves in Vietnam? To top it off, all these chemicals were dumped in the country when they left after their &amp;ldquo;defeat&amp;rdquo;. The Vietnamese were left to deal with these toxic residues of warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there is the glorification of the American war veterans. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forbes.com/sites/gregvistica/2016/06/21/should-we-forgive-bob-kerrey/&#34;&gt;Bob Kerrey&lt;/a&gt;, a decorated war veteran, was made a senator and he did not admit to his crimes till 2001 when independent agencies uncovered &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Kerrey#Thanh_Phong_raid&#34;&gt;the incident&lt;/a&gt;. He and his squadron had pulled out Vietnamese civilians, mostly women and children, killed and disemboweled them during a raid in one of the villages. Where are these stories when the popular media depicts the war veterans?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Where are the explanations?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many more gruesome pictures in the album, of the horrors that USA wrecked upon Vietnam and it&amp;rsquo;s people. Look them up and read up on these topics if you want to be reminded of what the world&amp;rsquo;s western idol is really like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnam is trying to forget war and move forward and this is what is happening as a result. History is being ignored, forgotten and erased. America has done an excellent job of shielding it&amp;rsquo;s youth from the havoc they have and are creating throughout the world. They are made to believe in America&amp;rsquo;s greatness without having to learn what gory foundations that so-called greatness lies on. I am not suggesting that America lives in the past and constantly apologises for the crimes that it&amp;rsquo;s country had committed. But such ignorance of it&amp;rsquo;s history is appalling. It is propaganda staring us right into our faces. The voices of people like Chomsky are easily sidelined in such an ignorant setting and the loud believers and peddlers of the American dream are the ones heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;bidding-adieu&#34;&gt;Bidding Adieu&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I returned to Phuong&amp;rsquo;s place towards the evening. I had another talk scheduled with two students. The two were sisters, one around 20 and the other older. The younger one was a student and was interested in travelling. The older one was a teacher and had a bad case of car sickness which prevented her from travelling. I talked to them for a while and then went out to have some dinner. After dinner, Phuong and another girl from the staff invited me to join them for some dessert. We went to a nearby place to have a bowl of yoghurt and fruits which was pretty nice. We talked about my life and travels mostly. Phuong was surprised to learn that I was travelling after marriage and seemed to me pretty impressed by Parul. She was also interested in learning about how things differed between Vietnam and India. I explained her to the best of my ability how and why things in India were the way they were. We had a lot of time to talk since the rains had started pouring again. It was a repetition of the last night and we tried in vain to wait it out. Eventually we borrowed a couple of umbrellas from the vendor and walked back to the center while getting ourselves partially drenched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got up the next morning and packed my bags. I said goodbye to Phuong who was sitting at the reception. I got the printouts of my Cambodian visa on my way to the bus stop. I took the usual bus route back to District One and finished my daily post on the way. The journey to &lt;em&gt;Ben Thanh&lt;/em&gt; market was short and uneventful as always.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I walked from &lt;em&gt;Ben Thanh&lt;/em&gt; bus stop to the &lt;em&gt;Phuong Heng&lt;/em&gt; office, a few young fellows walked up to me and asked if they could practice some English with me. It was similar to what I had experienced in Hue. I talked to them and they talked back. Some of them were students and some were working. It was an interesting experience as always. They had an interesting exercise where in they tried to sell a pen to me in exchange for something I had. I gave them a packet of cookies, the only thing on me that I could barter. I told them the proverb about the pen being mightier than the sword and it fascinated them. They also gave me a 200 VND bill as a souvenir before saying goodbye. I was definitely going to miss this country and it&amp;rsquo;s people! üò•&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Conversations in English&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got roped in by four more young girls once before eventually finding my way to the bus service office. Phuong Heng&amp;rsquo;s 1 PM bus was not running so they offered me a ticket for a 11:30 AM bus by another service, Long Phuong. I bought the ticket and decided to make the most of the half an hour till the bus by grabbing a bowl of &lt;em&gt;Pho&lt;/em&gt;. I cleared my stash of Vietnamese Dong by buying some tidbits. I was ready to move out of Vietnam now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Long Phuong bus was not as comfortable as the one I had taken on my last journey to Phnom Penh. The person next to my seat was an old Vietnamese man who now lived in Houston. His entire family had moved to the USA and he had none left in Vietnam anymore. He was travelling across the border to Cambodia for just a couple of days. The intent seemed to be the casinos on this side of the border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The border crossing at Bavet was slightly stricter than the last time but nothing that would make one break a sweat. I ate a &lt;em&gt;Bo Kho Bhanh Mi&lt;/em&gt; while waiting for the assistant to come with our passports. The waiters at the restaurant were amused by my knowledge of the dish&amp;rsquo;s name. I slept some more on the way to Phnom Penh and the bus reached the city as uneventfully as the last time. I needed another top up to reactivate my Cambodian SIM card. It is amazing how much simpler everything is in Cambodia. I had needed long frustrating sessions of charades to get data recharges done in Vietnam. The level on English of the Cambodian people made it much easier to explain what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rushed to the Sorya bus stand to check if I could catch an onwards bus on the same day. I had missed the last bus by 30 minutes. I decided to stay in Velcommen again for the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Phnom Penh by night&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rude staff was rude as the last time. The &lt;em&gt;firang&lt;/em&gt; owner saw me in with some ease. I spent the night eating dinner, reliving Cambodia&amp;rsquo;s dollar economy and working a bit. I slept early since I was tired and because I had an early bus to catch the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had initially planned a month long trip in Cambodia but had to shorten it because I needed to rush back to Vietnam. It had gotten converted into something of an extended visa run. Phnom Penh was my first exposure to Cambodia and I noticed a very striking contrast when comparing this country to Vietnam. The few days spent in Phnom Penh helped me understand the whys of it. I went through a series of moving experiences that have helped me appreciate the country better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;nationality-issues-on-a-rainy-day&#34;&gt;Nationality Issues on a Rainy Day&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a handful of chores on my first morning in &lt;strong&gt;Phnom Penh&lt;/strong&gt;. The most important was the reason I had rushed here; I needed to check about my Vietnam visa. But before that, I wanted to get a Cambodian SIM card to satisfy my need for connectivity. The rates varied slightly but I finally got a SIM and mobile internet package from &lt;strong&gt;SMART&lt;/strong&gt; for 5 USD. The internet here is horrible though, both WiFi and 3G. It is only slightly better than Myanmar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked up to &lt;strong&gt;Cina Travel&lt;/strong&gt;, one of the recommended travel agencies to get a visa processed by. Half way between explaining the rates to me, the guy asked me my nationality. To the answer that I was an Indian, he exclaimed a quiet &amp;ldquo;Oh&amp;rdquo; and removed the rate card. Then he told me that the visa processing rate would be a bit higher for me and it would be on a &lt;em&gt;request basis&lt;/em&gt;. This meant that I had to pay more to get the visa and there was no guarantee that the visa would be granted. However, in the case that the visa was declined, I would be refunded the money I paid. I went into my WTF mode. I had just started considering that the entire Indian stigma was within the country and in my head. I sat down to evaluate my options. Applying at the embassy directly was one possible option. But people use travel agents to make the process simpler. If these guys were saying it would be on a request basis, it might actually be a significant task. Also, I doubted that application fees would be refunded in case I applied to the embassy and was declined. Then there was the option of flying into Vietnam and getting another visa on arrival. But this was significantly more expensive. I concluded that I would give it a shot here, and would continue with my original travel plans if the visa was declined. I was not losing out on much since the amount would be refunded to me if the visa was declined. I paid the required 68 USD to put in a visa request for a 3 month single entry visa and hoped for the best. Just for the sake of comparison, it cost 56 USD for Europeans and other &amp;ldquo;Westerners&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought of going to Wat Phnom to make something of my afternoon. Turned out that I was not to see things my way this afternoon. I had barely walked a hundred meters when it started raining. I sought the shelter of a shed over a closed shop and stood trapped there for more than an hour! The rains were coming down relentlessly and the heavy wind blew the lighter drops on me. I took comfort in the fact that I was not the only one who had got caught unaware. The &lt;em&gt;tuk-tuks&lt;/em&gt; stopped to let the sheets down on the side of their carts. The drivers got drenched to keep their passengers dry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8392/29383611165_1c0f240872.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;rains-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Monsoon showers surprising Phnom Penh&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was shifting around to find a spot where the water splashing off the pavement would not get me. The rains were greeted with mixed emotions by everyone I saw on the road. Those that had been caught without preparation were cursing it and rushing away. Those who were better prepared hurried to get their rain jackets on. A few children went past on cycles, getting drenched in the rains and being ecstatic about it as only they could be. I think they are the only ones who whole heartedly welcome the monsoons showers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8309/29275313132_954b028c92.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;rains-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Everything paused&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After more than an hour of standing in the same spot, I started walking back to the hostel when the rain slowed down to a drizzle. Even the drizzle stopped by the time I reached the hostel. I moved my poncho from the main bag to the smaller one in preparation for the next time. I met a few of my dorm mates. The French-Moroccan, who had been there for some time, had got some delicious fruits from a mart nearby and insisted that I try them. He told me that they gave away fruits at discounted rates after mid-noon. The German in the bunk below me was playing his guitar beautifully. I tortured myself when I came to know that he had been practicing for just 3-4 months but then I was at ease when I learnt he was a pianist as well. The Moroccan had been travelling for 3 years now. He stayed put in one place for 3-4 months before moving on. He was trying to learn Cambodian so that he could have a conversation with his girlfriend&amp;rsquo;s parents who had left the country as refugees. The German was in Cambodia for an adventure trip with his brother. This was the end of his trip and his brother had left while he was killing days till his flight was due. He lived in New Zealand before this and did not wear footwear until it was absolutely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone was going to grab some dinner and I decided to join them. There were three new English people who had come in. There was another girl who looked Indian and had an Indian name (Nisha) but flatly refused a connection when I asked her if she had any. Her second name was Polish and that was the nationality she went by. I dropped the discussion seeing her unwillingness and talked to the English instead. The two guys had just spent a month in India and the girl was going there in December. On the topic of brexit, they thought it to be stupid as well. Well then, I wondered, who did find it a good idea? Anyway, since the rains had stopped I was planning to do something. I paid for my food and left while the German and Polish took their time to eat. The Cambodians seem less given to cheating you out of your money than the Vietnamese. That is one good thing about them despite their poverty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;phnom-penh&#34;&gt;Phnom Penh!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally managed to reach &lt;strong&gt;Wat Phnom&lt;/strong&gt;. The sun had set and the rain washed complex was lit up and looked extremely beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to pay a dollar to walk in and was not handed a ticket in receipt. This I did not like but I tried to not let it spoil my mood. I walked around the beautiful complex. There was hardly anyone around. It was a big park preserved in much of it&amp;rsquo;s natural setting with the pagoda on top of a small rocky mound in the center. The pagoda itself was not much to look at but was brightly lit up. There was a massive watch made on the slanting ground on the southern side which was somewhat ridiculous since one could not see the time in it, either from down below or from the top of the rock. I walked around and climbed up to the &lt;em&gt;wat&lt;/em&gt;. There was a modern looking building on the western side which was very oddly not in keeping with the entire nature around. Upon going down I found a sign of &amp;ldquo;Arts and Crafts Center&amp;rdquo; on the gate. It was still under construction but I thought they could have blended it much better with the ambience of the pagoda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Lovely Wat Phnom&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked out and went to the riverside. I was supposed to meet up with Eitan and Daniel at the night market which was along the river. As I walked towards it, I came upon a dead patch. Apparently the night market is just a weekend thing. I messaged Eitan about the same and we decided to meet at the &lt;strong&gt;Kandal Market&lt;/strong&gt; which was a literal stone throw away from the hostel. I walked back to the hostel to wait for a confirmation from the guys and walked out 20 minutes later supposing that they might be having trouble getting in touch without WiFi. The market was closed but I walked around it to find some interesting food stalls. A bunch of men were sitting and drinking beers and singing songs. One of them was beating a bucket as a makeshift drum. I walked by with a smile. Daniel and Eitan were nowhere to be seen though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8097/29273634342_1883e4afbe.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;market-4&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Street-side delicacies&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally got a message from Eitan telling me there were at some &lt;strong&gt;Snack Bar&lt;/strong&gt; and he sent me the location. It was 1.7 km away on the other side of the tourist area. I was wondering why they did not come to the market as decided and reasoned that maybe they had got lazy. Anyway, I went up to the place but could not find the bar. Turned out that the GPS had messed up! They were right next to the market, maybe a couple of hundred meters, so I walked back to where they were. üòì Eitan bought me a beer for his fuck up so everything was good. üòÜ Snack Bar was a small French owned place. The owner cum bartender was a cool guy by the name of Frank. There were some regulars sitting around and there and there was us. I had no idea how and why Daniel and Eitan had landed here but it did not matter. We joked around, tried learning some Khmer and drank some beers. One of the regulars bought us a round as well! It was really nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left to find something to eat. We had some pork and rice at a street side place that was pretty decent. Then we walked around to find another bar to sit and drink in. Phnom Penh is (in) famous for a lot of reasons and girlie bars are one of them. One of the famous strips was right next to where we were and we walked there to check it out. Curious to know what they were like, we went in one and were hustled by a lot of girls so we rushed out immediately. Daniel felt downright sad for the working girls and Eitan was playing the joker. We decided to try my hostel to see if we could hang out with some travellers but even the hostel was dead. We ended up on the riverside promenade and got a few beers from a bar truck (yes, there is such a thing; think food truck sans the food and with alcohol) and sat by the riverside to drink. The weather was nice and we discussed philosophy, war and politics. These guys were just 24, had been in a war and had experienced things that I could probably never imagine. They told me war was hell but I could not help but feel that a war, irrespective of the scale, should be decisive. I just felt bad for those who had to live day in and day out caught in a war zone with no end to their miseries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finished our beers and decided to check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g293940-d324074-Reviews-Sharky_Bar_and_Restaurant-Phnom_Penh.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharky&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which has the reputation of being the longest running rock n&amp;rsquo; roll bar in Indochina! üé∏ Sharky was a big establishment with only a handful of people. This was not the peak of the tourist season and there are a few &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.travelfish.org/board/post/cambodia/17588_beware--sharky-s-bar-in-phnom-penh-&#34;&gt;bogus reviews&lt;/a&gt; online that might have cost Sharky some of it&amp;rsquo;s prospective customers. I find such obtuse tourists (referring to the review above) insufferable. They have a superiority complex and they have no idea how to deal with issues politely.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Sharky has a slow day&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we played a few games of pool and drank some beers. The music was turned down but they were playing songs that I had never heard played in bars before; I mean, who the hell plays &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xc1PHk9FhIk&#34;&gt;Green Eyed Lady&lt;/a&gt;? üç∫ ‚úå I loved the time there and then we walked out, split up, and headed to our respective hostels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;True story!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;coffee-culture&#34;&gt;Coffee &amp;amp; Culture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up a little late on the next day, mostly because of laziness. I was still sleepy but got out of bed anyway. The bunk bed was so wobbly that I was always afraid I was going to wake up the person below me if I moved. I freshened up and walked till one of the temples nearby, marked on the map as &lt;strong&gt;Wat Ounalom&lt;/strong&gt;. It was in the middle of a residential complex and since I was approaching it from the wrong side (as usual), I missed the entrance the first time around. The &lt;em&gt;stupas&lt;/em&gt; here seemed to be a part of the residential complex. You could see laundry stands sitting between the &lt;em&gt;stupas&lt;/em&gt; or rice strewn around for drying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8396/29381658445_e48a20681b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;wat-ounalom-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Residential stupas&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the annex to the main temple though. The wall that separated it from the main temple had some impressive art of &amp;ldquo;samudra manthan&amp;rdquo; and more scenes out of the Hindu mythological stories. There were statues of Vishnu, Shiva and Bramha with the omnipresent &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayavarman_VII&#34;&gt;Jayavaram VII&lt;/a&gt;, the great Khmer king. It was interesting to see how the Hindu gods had changed in appearance out here, in the shape of their bodies, their postures and demeanour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7557/28760232383_b0889ca440.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;wat-ounalom-4&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Statues and murals&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked around to the front of the temple. The level of detail in all the stone and wood works were mind blowing. I felt that the craftsmanship here was way more evolved than India or Myanmar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Impressive craftsmanship&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;tuk-tuk&lt;/em&gt; driver caught sight of me and came around to joke about. He said that the women of his country would love my beard. He was funny enough, but he pestered me all the same. He wanted to take me around to some &lt;em&gt;wat&lt;/em&gt; that had a lot of monkeys and bats. This is a big problem in Cambodia. The &lt;em&gt;tuk-tuk&lt;/em&gt; and motodop drivers think that constantly courting a tourist will increase their chances of making a sale. I find it nothing more than irritating and it tends to have the opposite effect on me. Had he just told me about it and let me think over it, I might have considered. Just because he kept at it, I grew obtuse about not even considering his offer. Anyway, I guess this problem will go away as the country&amp;rsquo;s tourism matures. Currently there are way too many &lt;em&gt;tuk-tuk&lt;/em&gt; drivers; combine it with the poverty and you can understand why things are the way they are. I evaded this guy by going around and exiting through the other side. Then I sat in the nearby coffee shop and had some Khmer bread, a pork bun and a glass of cold milk coffee. The coffee here wasn&amp;rsquo;t half as good as the Vietnamese version!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8321/29381389395_e82f847103.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;khmer-bread-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Khmer bread&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Royal Palace was up ahead and I walked up to it. The &lt;em&gt;tuk-tuk&lt;/em&gt; drivers were quick to tell me that the palace and the museum were closed till post-lunch. Perhaps I would consider one of the many other options that they were providing. I used the excuse of waiting for friends to shrug them off and went to sit by the riverside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8385/28757553514_d1410edffb.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;riverside-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Riverside promenade&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat working on the daily insta update when another &lt;em&gt;tuk-tuk&lt;/em&gt; driver came up to me and started telling me about the options I had for sightseeing. I heard him out but I really needed to get back to my work. I finally managed to push the insta post and shrugged off this &lt;em&gt;tuk-tuk&lt;/em&gt; guy as well. But there were far too many of them. There was still time for the palace and museum to reopen and I thought I could use the time to work. But where? There was a real dearth of &amp;ldquo;sit and work&amp;rdquo; kind of places out here. I eventually decided to go to the &lt;strong&gt;Costa Coffee&lt;/strong&gt; which I had initially skipped because it would be too expensive for my budget. But seeing that I was wasting my time otherwise, I walked up to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8480/28757495104_985f43ec2e.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;costa&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Costa üíó&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ordered a large cappuccino and sat writing. An old friend had pinged and I talked to her about my travels as well. Around half past two, I shut the laptop and walked out, debating whether I wanted to go to the palace or not. I eventually decided against it and thought I would go around the palace to the Independence Monument and then return for the National Museum. I ran into Daniel and Eitan in front of the palace gate. They were going to see the silver pagoda in the palace complex and I told them I was skipping it in favour of the museum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked along the road to the south of the palace. There were official looking buildings on one side and a park under construction on another. The &lt;strong&gt;Independence Monument&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;King&amp;rsquo;s Statue&lt;/strong&gt; were in the middle of a vast open space that had a paved surface and some bushes for adornment. There was no tree to break the sun&amp;rsquo;s glare. There were not many people either, just me sweating buckets in the heat and a few people jogging away merrily. I walked up till the monument and took a few pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Iconic Independence Monument&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started walking back towards the museum. It closed at 5 PM and I wanted to get in by 4 so that I had enough time to see it at leisure. The entire area around the palace had beautiful structures which might or might not have been open for public viewing. The walk was quite nice, though the narrow roads and rowdy traffic somewhat limited the enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Sculpting Workshops&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went around looking for the entrance of the &lt;strong&gt;National Museum&lt;/strong&gt; and finally found it right next to the palace. I bought a 5 USD ticket to get in. I remembered having read about an audio guide as well but the woman at the counter denied me one and I was unable to figure out whether she meant there wasn&amp;rsquo;t any guide or they were out of it. Anyway, the reason hardly mattered and I went in. The museum turned out to be really nice. I was glad I chose it over the palace. History and culture is definitely my thing. The museum had some amazing art work from the &lt;strong&gt;Angkor period&lt;/strong&gt;. I got to know a few things about the Khmer empire, its rise and it&amp;rsquo;s outreach during it&amp;rsquo;s best period. Khmer empire was heavily influenced by the Hindu culture from the immediate west. There were several statues and busts from that period which were labelled as Hindu gods and goddesses. It was interesting to see how their shapes and sizes had changed in comparison to their Indian counterparts. All the figures were more rotund and the limbs had a softer touch to them. There was always a slight belly and none of the gods, even the warriors, were fierce in their looks. The most imposing creatures were the &lt;em&gt;garuda&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;naga&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;vanara&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;yaksha&lt;/em&gt;. The goddesses did not have as heavy breasts as the Indian ones and they wore much more generic adornments that made it difficult to differentiate between the genders at times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked at an easy pace, reading most of the descriptions and paying attention to individual articles. There was a transition to some modern art and then a short section for the post-Angkor era where the currently prevalent &lt;strong&gt;Theravada Buddhism&lt;/strong&gt; was honoured. I wrapped up the sections and went into the beautiful courtyard and sat for a while till the closing bell announced the time for departure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8403/28759735603_50239a49f7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;museum-5&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;National Museum courtyard&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was ambling in the museum, I had received a message from Cina Travels asking me to come and collect my passport before their closing time of 5:30 PM. I walked there trying to guess whether my visa request had been successful. The suspense was short-lived though as I reached their office in just 10 minutes. I had a Vietnamese visa for 3 months. This meant that I was going forth with my plan to teach in Vietnam for a month (or more). I walked back to the hostel and collected my laundry on the way. I ate another round of Khmer bread and observed how the locals ate it. It was not to be made into a sandwich as I had been doing so far!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8603/29302048011_c06d76d151.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;khmer-bread-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Kevin approves of Khmer bread!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a bath and sat writing in the hostel. A few new people came in; apparently French and throwing a tantrum about something or the other. I was in no mood for socializing tonight. I had enough work to keep me busy. I stepped out to grab a bite. I ate some rice and &amp;ldquo;cheese&amp;rdquo; from a street-side shop with suspect hygiene. The taste was not too great as well so I left half of it, something that I rarely do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cambodia Tip #4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be specially careful about where you get your food from. The street side places are not as hygienic as Vietnam or India. Try not to get cold things from suspect places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I got a bottle of beer and sat by the riverside drinking it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8132/29346915296_36e1d20d04.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;riverside-night&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Riverside by the night&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The working women were hunting. I politely declined the ones that approached me. Then a man came and sat next to me and started talking. I am not sure what he wanted or if he even wanted anything, but the many references to him thinking that I had money because I was travelling made me quite uncomfortable. I shook his hand and walked away. I walked along the riverside watching people find themselves companions for the night. I ended up in one of the more public spaces with people jogging and working out on gym machines. Some kids were playing with a &lt;em&gt;chinlone&lt;/em&gt; and I sat down to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few Cambodian youngsters were hanging out in the area and I saw a couple kissing a little distance away. I wondered why it is that Indian society is so against love. I had been struck by a sudden epiphany on the bus from Saigon as well. For a country that is obsessed with romance and love songs, there is not much love to be seen in real life. Love before marriage is frowned upon irrespective of whether it culminates in a marriage or not. The society makes it almost impossible for lovers to be together. As an unmarried couple (for we refuse to acknowledge it&amp;rsquo;s existence) you cannot get an apartment to move into together. Expressing love in public places, which is the only resort left to many, draws unnecessary attention and gets you beaten up by hooligans in the name of moral policing. What a bunch of hypocrites we are!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I returned to the hostel after a while and sat down to write. I got to learn a bit more of the Polish girl&amp;rsquo;s story as well. She was actually an American passport holder and had her passport stolen in Siem Reap. She was having a tough time dealing with the embassies and had to bribe policemen to get reports, something that she was clearly not used to. No wonder she was dismissive about her Asian roots because it was what was giving her the most trouble. An American passport of a non-white (yes, that&amp;rsquo;s racist) is much more dangerous in the hands of miscreants, as per the US Embassy. I wished her luck and returned to my work which I did for a while before falling asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;house-of-horrors&#34;&gt;House of Horrors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up in the morning and extended my stay another day. Cambodia has a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/jun/05/trains-phnom-penh-sihanoukville-kampot&#34;&gt;new train service&lt;/a&gt; that I was planning to take. The train ran from Friday to Sunday and I could use the day (being Thursday) to see the Genocide Museum. I asked the hostel owner about the train and he had no idea about it. He had just heard some faint news about a restarting of passenger train services. The service was &lt;strong&gt;THAT&lt;/strong&gt; new! I decided to book a ticket just to be sure. I did not want to miss my chance of experiencing something so novel in the country just because I was lazy. So I walked to the railway station first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8405/28759643823_e8e2331a46.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;pp-buildings&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Contrasting buildings in Phnom Penh&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I passed the Central Market on the way but did not go in. The entrance of the station was a little difficult to find and I, like I am accustomed to do, walked in through the wrong gate. A guard came running and asked me to go back but I had already spotted what looked like a reservation counter and I did not know I was coming from the wrong way. I thought that this might be some kind of trick of theirs which was aimed at discouraging people to use the railway. I had read all kinds of stories online, mostly outdated but you never know. I insisted that I needed to go to the building but he failed to understand me. I, in turn, refused to go back and then he finally pointed at another exit which was closer to the building. Okay, I would take that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8302/29345720246_9fa3060838.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;railway-station-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;The wrong side of railway station&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I approached the reservation building from the correct side this time. It was obvious now that I had been coming from the wrong side but how was I to know! Plus a &amp;ldquo;wrong way&amp;rdquo; into a railway station is something unknown to me. The reservation process itself was pretty simple. I handed 6 USD and was given a hand written ticket that was even less official looking than Myanmar&amp;rsquo;s. But I knew about the recency of the service and just confirmed the date and time before leaving. I walked back to the market and sat in a cafe to kill time till after the lunch hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coffee was expensive but they had WiFi and I needed to work. I sat there for two hours or so and then left for the &lt;strong&gt;S21 Genocide Museum&lt;/strong&gt;. I walked all the way, some 40 minutes or so. The sun was out and it was a little hot. I reached the museum which was bang in the middle of the residential area. I knew very little about this place, just that it used to be a high school that was converted into a torture center. The entrance fee was 3 USD and it was another 3 for the audio tour. I opted for it; this was to be my first audio tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent 3-4 hours in that horror house. The audio tour was very well done, probably a bit too well. I was moved to tears more than once. It was a sad thing that had happened and so unjust! The &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Rouge&#34;&gt;Khmer Rouge&lt;/a&gt; had ousted a supposedly American backed government in Cambodia, the Khmer Republic. Khmer Rouge was socialist in their philosophy and the people welcomed them initially. Then they started ruling by the iron fist that is typical of such forms of government. International communications were cut off and people were forced into the countryside to do agricultural work, something on which the Polpot government had based itself. A series of secret security offices were established across the country. S21 was the biggest of them and it was here that the head of prisons, Duch, operated from. The supposed &amp;ldquo;offenders&amp;rdquo; were brought to S21 to be tortured till they admitted to whatever crimes they were charged with, mostly of being American or Russian spies and for leaking information outside the country. &lt;strong&gt;Angkar&lt;/strong&gt;, the secret police, became a paranoia driven organisation which kept feeding such prisons with people who had no idea what they were being brought in for. There were mass marriages organised in order for women to give birth to babies that Angkar could mould into future workforce. The women were worked immediately before and after delivery, and the babies usually died of malnutrition. There were pictures of prisoners that the security guards could not get rid of in the hurry that they fled. There was anguish in some eyes, horror in others, sadness in others still, shock in some and some showed their resilience by smiling. It was utterly horrifying; an entire generation scarred by the madness of a few. I wondered what &lt;a href=&#34;http://time.com/6997/cambodias-khmer-rouge-trials-are-a-shocking-failure/&#34;&gt;justice&lt;/a&gt; would be in such a case and if there is a justice at all for such situations. If not, then is justice simply an illusion?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Scenes from the Genocide Museum&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The audio tour had many interviews from survivors and there were exhibitions in the museum highlighting certain aspects of the Polpot regime and how it affected the society still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phnom Penh Tip #1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do take the audio tour when you go to the S21 Genocide Museum. You will learn so much more about a history that needs to be remembered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was probably the last tourist to leave the place. I listened to all the stories in the audio guide. I had gone through all the cells and looked at most of the exhibitions. There were a few children playing football with a &lt;em&gt;chinlone&lt;/em&gt; in the complex. I saw it as a representation of how the people were getting over their horrible past. Now it was just a memory for them, something that the world needed to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;A fresh start&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked back to the city and ate some fruits and fried noodles on the way. I spent the rest of the evening in the bed sorting some pictures. The German is a funny guy and it would have been nice to know him better but I was utterly bogged down by my backlog and wanted to get done with it. I watched France defeat Germany in the semifinals and cursed Euro&amp;rsquo;s quality of football once again before going to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;royal-railways&#34;&gt;Royal Railways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up and checked out. The owner joked that he thought I&amp;rsquo;d never leave, but he got quite interested when I told him that I was taking the train. I walked back to the cafe I had sat in the previous day and sat working on my blog. I got up to leave at 2:00 PM and walked the rest of the way till the station. The skies were overclouded but I was hopeful of making it to the station in time. The rains came down when I was just a hundred meters away. I ran the distance but still got a little soaked in the sudden heavy downpour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to wait till 2:30 PM for the boarding to start. The train was a really short one. Just two coaches of which just one was partially full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8308/29271527932_3d4663394c.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;pp-train-3&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Train!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was one of the two foreigners who were taking the train. I settled down on a seat and had it to myself. I stretched out on the seat opposite to mine since that was empty as well. The train started 3 minutes to 3 PM and went a little ahead and turned back on another track to pick a luggage carriage. Then it went ahead again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AC was a Panasonic cooler that was installed over the door and the attendants came in with remotes to adjust temperatures when required. There was WiFi as well though the router gave trouble and it seemed to be simply running on dongles. They were still figuring out stuff but the entire effort that they were putting into the re-instantiation of the passenger rail service was commendable.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Uncrowded&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since the S21 tour I had started seeing Cambodia as a country that was rebuilding itself instead of one that was in shambles. Phnom Penh had it&amp;rsquo;s share of construction going on. There were high rises slowly and steadily making there mark in the city&amp;rsquo;s skyline. They will come of age if the world lets them be. Everything takes care of itself in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>

&lt;p&gt;It seems like I had been planning a solo backpacking trip overseas for ages. In late May 2016, I finally took off for a trip through South East Asia like I had always wanted to. I was dismissive of all deterring arguments. I cared not what was happening to me or around me. This trip was all that mattered right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is about when I got to Hu·∫ø in central Vietnam. I took a train from Dong Hoi. Hu·∫ø was the last imperial capital of Vietnam as well as one of the border towns in the north south civil war. It has a lot of history to it and some specialty cuisines as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;hues-of-hu·∫ø&#34;&gt;Hues of Hu·∫ø&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked out of the station after saying goodbye to Bibi and Miss Han. Google Maps showed that the hotel I had booked was just 1.5 kms away so I did not even consider the many &lt;em&gt;xe om&lt;/em&gt; drivers offering me a drop. Hu·∫ø seemed like a lively town. It was lit up and people sat in restaurants and cafes enjoying food and drinks. I liked the vibes of this place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8297/28877706956_13400247cd.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;hue-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Lively colours of Hu·∫ø&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to the hostel quickly enough. It was immediately south of one of the hospitals, well before the backpacker district. I had booked a single room that was falling in my budget. It had been a while since I had spent some time in the comfort of having no one around. I gladly accepted this break from hostels and all their activity and socialising. I am not a very social person to begin with. Anyway, since I was getting a single room with good reviews at a fraction more than what a hostel dorm would have cost me, I was up to spending a night in my preferred style!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hotel, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.agoda.com/bien-khoi-hostel/hotel/hue-vn.html&#34;&gt;Bien Khoi&lt;/a&gt;, was a little off the spot marked on Google Maps but a local helped me find it. This was a new hotel; just 30 days new. The woman at the reception barely spoke any English but one of her friends helped us out. I made more use of the Google Translate app as well. The narrow stairway led me to the third floor where my room was. It seemed nice and simple. It even had a balcony which I used just once during my stay. All in all, I would say, I had got a good bargain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8230/28804037512_80e1334df7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bien-khoi-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Private room!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quickly took a bath and went out to get something to eat. It was getting late and Vietnam&amp;rsquo;s more local food joints tend to close early. I got &lt;em&gt;c∆°m chi√™n&lt;/em&gt; (fried rice) from a restaurant and then went ahead to check out the backpacker district which Michaella had told me about. The lights got brighter and the streets livelier as I approached the area. The &lt;em&gt;xe om&lt;/em&gt; and cyclo riders also started pestering me. They offered me everything from opium to prostitutes. I went into my WTF mode. I had gotten into the habit of politely refusing any offers made to me but there were so many of them here that I quickly learnt to ignore. Then there were some that tried to get your attention in any possible way. One of the &lt;em&gt;xe om&lt;/em&gt; riders rode for 50-80 feet along my side constantly talking to me and showing me a packet of marijuana that he thought would interest me. Smacking him across the face would have interested me but I refrained for the fear of prolonged engagement. I walked straight out of the area, ditching my previous plan to grab a drink somewhere. I understand that people like to party and I have nothing against them or those who facilitate it in any way, but I do not understand why they cannot leave alone the ones who don&amp;rsquo;t want to join in! Anyway, the offers by cyclo and motorbike riders continued for a bit and then stopped when I had put enough distance between myself and the ghetto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8853/28293574093_65144cd0d7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;hue-riverside-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Riverside&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked to the river side and walked along the empty street. The shops had closed down and there was barely any tourist to be seen. A few artists were engaged in creating amazing pieces that they would sell at unjustified low prices the next day. I preferred such peace and quiet more than the loud tourist areas. I walked around a bit before heading back to the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/140507143@N02/28293540173/in/album-72157671174977510/&#34; title=&#34;woodart&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8788/28293540173_b38f1cdc62.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;woodart&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;VIDEO : Creating art&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;imperial-capital&#34;&gt;Imperial Capital&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a really peaceful sleep and woke up late the next day. I decided to stay another night in this place and talked to the hotel manager about a suitable price. We agreed on the one agoda was listing. I am really curious about how that site works. Most of the hotels demand a higher rate when I ask them either for an extension or if I simply walk in to book a bed. One would have thought that agoda would be the more expensive of the two since there might be some service fee involved but it has never been so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I went out and looked for one of the more famous &lt;strong&gt;B√∫n b√≤ Hu·∫ø&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://goo.gl/maps/a2VWoHhi49K2&#34;&gt;shops&lt;/a&gt;. This dish is, as the name makes obvious, a specialty of Hu·∫ø. It is the classic &lt;em&gt;B√∫n b√≤&lt;/em&gt; noodle soup done in the imperial style of Hu·∫ø. I found the place and relished a large bowl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8327/28623881130_d75bd92c8a.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bun-bo-hue&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Kevin hearts B√∫n b√≤ Hu·∫ø&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I went to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g293926-d1121808-Reviews-Mandarin_Cafe-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html&#34;&gt;Mandarin Cafe&lt;/a&gt;, one of my wikivoyage discoveries. I am really glad of having gone to this one. The owner is a photographer and there are many excellent photographs of Vietnam on display. They are up for sale if any interests you. I had a banana pancake and a coffee and inquired about the rates of the buses to H·ªôi An. Then I picked up the map of the walking tour, the real reason I had gone to the Mandarin Cafe. The map and advice for the walking tour were free of cost. They even gave me a nice post card compliments of the restaurant. üòÄ I like such traveller friendly places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;On the banana pancake trail&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hu·∫ø was the last imperial capital of Vietnam. It was also a main player in the civil war that brought about the socialist revolution. The &lt;strong&gt;Perfume River&lt;/strong&gt; runs through the city and while most of the hotels and backpacker areas are south of the river, the north has the picturesque old city with a walled citadel. The walking tour map traced a nice route through the old city and gave a short history of every place of interest that would lie on the route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I crossed the &lt;strong&gt;Tr∆∞·ªùng Ti·ªÅn&lt;/strong&gt; bridge to the other side of the Perfume River which was pretty wide. The sun was not too hot and that made for a pleasant walk. I turned into one of the roads and entered the citadel through one of the many gates. There was the first layer of moat here and the wall was an impressive 8 meters wide fortification. It reminded me of the old Indian cities like Jaipur, just much less crowded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7751/28293572343_e907e63bd8.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;truong-tien-bridge-2&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Entering the citadel&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;War Museum&lt;/strong&gt; was up first but I seemed to have come in at the lunch hours. I decided to go ahead and come back for the museum if I felt like it. There were huge fighter jets and artillery guns on display that memorialized the civil war of Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8018/28623878310_38716618d5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;war-museum-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Passing the War Museum&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to the Imperial Museum next but it required a ticket which was the same as the one for the Imperial Palace. I walked along the southern wall of the palace complex and came upon the ticket counter, only to decide against buying the ticket. It cost a dear 150 kVND and I was not sure I wanted to see another palace. I assumed palaces are all similar inside; bedrooms and meeting rooms and halls for entertainment. I would have been interested in the Imperial Museum but there was no separate ticket for it. So I decided to forget all about the palace and the museums and enjoy the walk in the citadel. There was a big flag right opposite to the grand entrance of the palace and the two entrances to the citadel right next to the flag were flanked by big cannon guns.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Big flag and big guns&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked along the well shaded pathways on the outside of the palace moat. The moat was full of lotuses, flower that I had fallen in love with. I had not seen many lotuses in India and I had never seen ones as beautiful as I was seeing here. Incidentally, lotus is the national flower of Vietnam as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other side of the street had a variety of shops; mostly clothes, bikes and daily needs. I did the southern and western walls and then took the by-lanes into the more residential parts of the citadel. There was a lotus plantation of sorts and impressive street art to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8593/28877678986_e8dbb7e250.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;streetart-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Streetart!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I walked back to exit the citadel from the Eastern side, I ran into a wholesale market of electric appliances, fabric, motorbikes and what not! Outside the citadel was the more famous local market - &lt;strong&gt;Cho Dong Ba&lt;/strong&gt;. They had everything one could ask for. The back lane even had specialty shops for eggs and bananas!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8629/28291339274_215e5f6ab1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;market-5&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Most unexpected specialty shops&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked back across the river over the Tr∆∞·ªùng Ti·ªÅn Bridge and went to the Church that marked the end of the walking tour. I decided to head back to my room, which was close by, to cool down and rest my tired legs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;culture-exchange&#34;&gt;Culture Exchange&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to try some local food and I looked some places online and decided on a particular road to explore. I went to a more busy joint at the end of this road, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g293926-d3809346-Reviews-Hanh_Restaurant-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html&#34;&gt;Hanh Restaurant&lt;/a&gt;. This place was full of locals, which is always a good sign. It looked a little more expensive than my usual choices but I decided to sit myself down. The rice wraps were the snack of choice all around me but I was not in the mood of that one again. So I ordered a couple of new snacks from the menu. The waiter helped me choose them and offered to bring me half a plate of each. When the snacks came, he also explained how they were eaten. I liked the rice pudding one (B√°nh n·∫≠m) but did not like the shrimp tapioca thing (B√°nh b·ªôt l·ªçc) all that much. I topped off the snacks with a glass of delicious fruit yoghurt (fruit &lt;em&gt;lassi&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8707/28804025282_165d969dd7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;banh-nam&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;B√°nh n·∫≠m&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I went to the parks and walking street along the river. This place had it&amp;rsquo;s share of people. Hu·∫ø seemed to attract a lot of Vietnamese tourists as well. I was walking along the street taking pictures of the Tr∆∞·ªùng Ti·ªÅn Bridge when a young girl walked up to me and started talking. She was a student and wanted to practice her English. Could I spare a few minutes to help her out? Of course I could! We sat next to the river and she started asking me the usual questions that must have formed her repertoire for foreigners. Where was I from? How long had I been in Vietnam? Where all had I travelled? I asked her some questions as well. Her name was Gau and she was from H·ªôi An. She was studying medicine in Hu·∫ø. She told me, as I was to find out in a few days myself, that H·ªôi An was famous for cheap and good quality clothes. She did not know what Hu·∫ø was famous for. She was in the fifth year of her six year course. It took money or family connections to have a good career in Vietnam. She said she might just start a private practice after completing her education. Another friend of hers, An, joined us later. They knew that India had tropical climate like Vietnam&amp;rsquo;s. But did India have snow? I told them it did, high up in the mountains. They were quite fascinated by snow, having never had seen it. Vietnam did not have snow in any part of the country. Once we had exhausted the possible list of questions, I expressed my desire to continue walking and we said goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8150/28293542683_a7f769b7d8.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;truong-tien-bridge-4&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Tr∆∞·ªùng Ti·ªÅn lights up&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must have walked barely fifty steps when another girl came up to me with a similar request. I nodded in agreement. I could not think of a better way to spend my evening. I sat down with her and another male friend of hers and we started talking. Another guy with pretty good English joined us later. These were Loan, Hom and Lin, in that order. The starting questions were done and dusted soon enough. Hom was studying law and we talked about the economies of our countries, the taxes and other similar things. He said he thought I was friendly and smiled a lot. I think that is one of the most important things I have learnt on this trip. They were impressed by my pronunciation of Vietnamese words, which is not at all an easy task for foreigners. They wanted to know how I found the traffic in Vietnam, another thing that the foreigners usually struggle with. I shrugged my shoulders and told them that this was nothing compared to what we had in India. üòé Lin wanted to know why the women in India wear a red spot (&lt;em&gt;bindi&lt;/em&gt;) on their foreheads. Loan wanted to know why we use our right hands in particular to eat. Then we got around to the subject of patriarchy. Vietnam has made long strides towards equality of genders. The men and women share the work outside and inside households. Loan told me that she had come to know that Indian men came back from work and did nothing while the women worked, cleaned and cooked. Much to my shame, I told her that it was quite true. But things were changing slowly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shoutout&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop being chauvinist pigs. Those of us who travel do not like to be put into embarrassing positions because of your stupidity. üòí&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what about religion? I told them that our predominant religions were Hinduism and Islam. Vietnam&amp;rsquo;s were Buddhism and Christianity, though there was an increasing number of non-religious people in Vietnam. In fact, Vietnam is one of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://humannationalityvn.blogspot.com/2015/11/the-chaging-trend-of-religions-in.html&#34;&gt;most non-religious&lt;/a&gt; countries in the world. Out here, they called these non-religious people &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo;, which, as per me, was a very apt way to put it. These guys were free; I told them that so was I. üòá&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked around some more after leaving the three. It had been an interesting day and I was starting to like the town a little despite the irritating cyclo and motorbike riders. I ate &lt;strong&gt;C∆°m B√¨nh D√¢n&lt;/strong&gt;, the commoner&amp;rsquo;s rice, that night. It was simply rice with an assortment of vegetables and meat. Cheap and filling as I like it. I ended the meal with a mango smoothie before heading to the room for another night of peaceful sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Typical C∆°m B√¨nh D√¢n stall&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;royal-tombs&#34;&gt;Royal Tombs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I changed to a new hostel after waking up. I went back to the B√∫n b√≤ Hu·∫ø place on the way and ate a bowl for breakfast. The new hostel seemed quite nice. It was outside the backpacker area and so there were less people around and I got my quiet. I rented out a bicycle for a nominal charge of 1 USD and took it for a ride. This was a city bike without gears and the roads turned out to be a bit challenging as soon as I left the city. I was planning to do a few royal tombs around town today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I headed to the &lt;strong&gt;Tomb of T·ª± ƒê·ª©c&lt;/strong&gt;, the one that was closest to the city. I rode on the main highway for some time before diving into the country roads. Google Map led me through quaint alleys before dropping me at the entrance of the tomb. It looked like a modest complex with a few shops that had set themselves up in front of the ticket counter. They invited me to avail free parking in their premises but I chose to pay the nominal 2 kVND parking for a cycle instead of risking a misunderstanding later on. The ticket to the tomb turned out to be a 100 kVND affair. I shook my head and bought the ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first building was the living quarters of T·ª± ƒê·ª©c and later became his temple. T·ª± ƒê·ª©c was the last emperor who enjoyed real power in Vietnam; he was followed by puppet kings installed by the French. This was his holiday palace, something of a retreat. The house was in the typical style of the old structures (temples and schools) I had seen in Hanoi. There was the courtyard and a backyard. The entire complex was pretty and big. It was interesting how the emperor had lived in utmost, though not overt, luxury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8785/28908984465_f122fbdb3a.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tu-duc-temple-6&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;T·ª± ƒê·ª©c&#39;s temple&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a lake in front of the building and an islet in the middle of it. It used to be populated with exotic birds and animals; the emperor enjoyed boat rides and walks there. Now there were just withering lotuses in the lake and lots of workers working on some project to beautify the islet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8683/28293550533_52bf150a8f.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tu-duc-complex-lake&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Lake and islet&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The living quarters had a throne room where you could rent out &amp;ldquo;royal&amp;rdquo; clothes and sit on the throne or palanquin to take pictures. üëë üì∑ üòÖ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8706/28833464971_1a17f3521a.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tu-duc-temple-10&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Royal palanquin&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was also a small sales counter for some impressive local art. Vietnam has the most beautiful quality of local artwork I have seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next building was the tomb and it was very strikingly different in architecture from the living quarter. The living quarters heeded to the emperor&amp;rsquo;s requirements in life and the tomb represented his journey in death. There is the courtyard with waiting stone mandarins and royal rides (horses and elephants) made of stone. These were arranged in two neat rows on either side. The courtyard led to a huge stone tablet up ahead that was inscribed with some script. The tablet and it&amp;rsquo;s shelter were flanked by two obelisks, one on either side. Further ahead was a walled enclosure with a gate. This enclosure contained the actual tomb in it&amp;rsquo;s center and felt something like a fairly simple maze. It was grand and quite morbid, as is to be expected of tombs. There were very few people around so it made for good photographs as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;T·ª± ƒê·ª©c&#39;s tomb&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met a guy from Cyprus (first Cypriot I have met) in the complex. He was on a vacation with his mother who he had managed to lose somehow. üòÇ He was in his middle ages and had been to India and had loved it! I think this is undoubtedly the best part about being an Indian traveller. You meet a lot of people have been to India and more often than not, they remember it fondly. This makes them smile in reminiscence and treat you with a warm bias when they talk to you. It is funny how you get to know more about your country and culture when you leave it. I walked around the other parts of the complex after T·ª± ƒê·ª©c&amp;rsquo;s tomb. There were some lesser known tombs of the other royal family members up ahead; some under renovation, some left to their abject state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8584/28833453941_16e8197ac3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tu-duc-prince-tomb-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Po&#39;ing around&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really liked this place, though the 100k still seemed too much. I walked around the extensive complex and ended up in the building next to the lake. I sat down to rest and enjoy the view. A tourist group came in after a while and the musicians, who had been resting, began to play. However, I was preparing to leave just then so I could appreciate the music very briefly. The instruments were interesting; strings, flutes and everyday things like cups and sticks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;VIDEO : Royal Musicians&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was planning to do some more tombs and I asked Google Maps for the route to the one closest to where I was. It took me through a pine plantation and village roads! I really prefer such small unused roads to the big highways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8788/28877658186_e7bea134ee.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;road-pine-forestation&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Pine plantation&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached the &lt;strong&gt;Tomb of Thi·ªáu Tr·ªã&lt;/strong&gt; in a short while. It seemed like an off-route place with very few tourists and I was half expecting there to be no ticket for this one. But there turned out to be one, and it was a 40 kVND worth. üò£ Hu·∫ø had really costly tickets. I had found the entry fee in Hanoi pretty reasonable for single monuments and structures but Hu·∫ø was too expensive. This complex did not seem to be much cared for as well. It lay in ruins which was it&amp;rsquo;s primary difference from T·ª± ƒê·ª©c&amp;rsquo;s tomb. The actual tomb was much the same in layout, though much less grand and much more in shambles. But there were beautiful lotus lakes in front of and behind the tomb to make up for the lost architectural beauty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Waiting mandarins&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to T·ª± ƒê·ª©c&amp;rsquo;s there was a living quarter/temple here as well but it was much too bare. I felt like I was walking through someone&amp;rsquo;s home while they were out on a vacation (not that I have ever done such a thing!). There courtyard and backyard here were probably prettier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cat came out of somewhere to eye me suspiciously walking about the complex. I fancied it to be the ghost of one of the owners keeping an eye on my movements. There was a jackfruit tree with fruits hanging ripe and ready for the picking. It felt way too private for a tourist attraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Spooky cat don&#39;t like me&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked out of the complex and sat down on a bench to get my money&amp;rsquo;s worth. A dog waited for me to settle down before deciding to take a nap itself. I was not going for more tombs. I was financially done for the day. I left this complex around 5 PM and saw no one at the ticket counter. I might as well have come in at this time. üòê&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rode the bicycle back to the city, running into a small traffic jam right before entering it. I returned the bike at the hostel and took a bath before going back to Mandarin Cafe for some comfort food. Baked potatoes and chocolate shake. I sat in a cafe near the hostel and finished the &lt;a href=&#34;http://grasskode.xyz/post/readings/john-hick-philosophy-of-religion/&#34;&gt;Philosophy of Religion&lt;/a&gt; book that had finally got interesting towards the end. I also learnt the difference between a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ca Phe Sua Da&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bac Xiu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. I went back to the hostel to work a bit after asking if the cafe would be open for the match later in the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I returned to the cafe and sat watching the Austria vs Portugal match. A guy from Manchester, Daniel, joined me and we talked about football and travelling. He had travelled India extensively and used to be a bar manager back home. Interesting guy. He had taken up a job teaching English in HCMC and was travelling in Vietnam with a friend before joining the school next month. He told me about a football match that was going to take place in Da Nang the coming weekend and we exchanged contacts so that he could get in touch if the plan materialized. Him being a ManU fan, we discussed the Ronaldo-Messi rivalry. Daniel left after the first half and I sat doing the insta and watched the rest of the match because it was going in the funny freak football way that was to be typical of this Euro Cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;leaving-town&#34;&gt;Leaving Town&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up early for the Chile vs Colombia match that was delayed because of a storm. Chile won and progressed to the Copa finals. I booked a ticket to H·ªôi An from the hostel. It was some bus service that I had not heard about but I decided not to be paranoid and give it a shot. I had time so I worked a bit and went to a nearby &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g293926-d1724500-Reviews-Nina_s_Cafe-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html&#34;&gt;cafe&lt;/a&gt; that was a tripadvisor success. The food was nice but a bit expensive, although I guess everything would be expensive when compared to the streetside places that I usually haunt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8653/28877649796_ba8aae6c9e.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ninas-cafe-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Nina&#39;s Cafe&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it was time, I went downstairs and a minivan came to pick me up. I was dropped at the main office of the bus service where the bus stood waiting. This was a &amp;ldquo;sleeper&amp;rdquo; bus; two levels of reclining seats arranged in three rows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8645/28840461031_98f8494957.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;sleeper-bus&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Sleeper tourist bus&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is how most of the tourist buses in Vietnam are. I felt a bit uncomfortable and stuck in those seats which were not my size. I was sleepy though and managed to drift off to sleep despite the cramped seats, cold AC and loud Vietnamese comedy show that was playing in the bus. I woke up a couple of times to see beautiful sceneries drift past my window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Through the window&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really liked Da Nang from what I saw while we crossed it. I had also gotten great reviews of the place from a few people during my travels. I was seriously considering coming to the city for a few days after H·ªôi An but my month in Vietnam was seeming too short now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like I had been planning a solo backpacking trip overseas for ages. In late May 2016, I finally took off for a trip through South East Asia like I had always wanted to. I was dismissive of all deterring arguments. I cared not what was happening to me or around me. This trip was all that mattered right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is about when I got to Ayutthaya, a small town 80 kilometers north of Bangkok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reaching-ayutthaya&#34;&gt;Reaching Ayutthaya&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bus reached Bangkok at 5:30 AM just as promised. I was somewhat relieved that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t earlier than expected as we had consistently experienced in Myanmar. It is no fun to catch an overnight bus that drops you off in the middle of the night. Bangkok was humid and the wet roads spoke of recent showers. The sun had crossed the horizon but was struggling to break free of the clouds that cluttered all around it. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t complaining. I walked up to the bus stand that was supposed to get me a bus till Hua Lampong Railway Station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7563/27651267225_4819fd7e95.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bangkok-cloudy&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Overcast Bangkok&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city was more active than I had expected it to be at 6 in the morning. People were going to their offices and taxis zoomed past with passengers going from somewhere I did not know to some place I did not care. What time did the offices start in Bangkok? 7 AM? I waited 10 minutes for the bus but the route number that I was waiting for (159) did not make an appearance. I decided that I would prefer walking to sitting around in the humidity. At least that way I had a fixed estimate of reaching the station. I started walking towards the Railway Station, passing through the streets of Bangkok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7268/27373133470_eea8fa8361.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bangkok-streets-4&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Early morning activity in Bangkok&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me 40 minutes to reach the station and I was sweating like a pig by that time. I went up to the ticket counter and was greeted by a well disposed officer. He smiled and I smiled back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(O - Officer, M - Me)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O : &lt;em&gt;Sawasdee Krab.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M : &lt;em&gt;Sawasdee Krab.&lt;/em&gt; Ticket to Ayutthaya. Next train.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O : Okay. &lt;strong&gt;types something on his keyboard and shows me the screen&lt;/strong&gt; 20 Baht.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M : Okay. &lt;strong&gt;handing him the money&lt;/strong&gt; What time is the train?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O : 7 o&amp;rsquo; clock. Platform 9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M : &lt;em&gt;Khob Khun Krab.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wait. 7 o&amp;rsquo; clock? I looked at my watch. 6:58.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M : Train at 7?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O : &lt;strong&gt;smiling&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Platform number 9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck! I picked my bags and ran to the platform. Fortunately it was the first platform I hit after the counter. I could see the train standing at a distance. The first coach was 2nd class. No. I ran on to the next coach. 3rd class. Yes. I jumped in and breathed a sigh of relief. I adjusted my luggage and checked my watch. 7:00. But the train did not start till 7:06. I felt a little stupid but it was alright I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7455/27577412971_2469742a33.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bangkok-hualampong-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Hua Lampong Station&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This train only had a few people scattered about on the seats randomly. The trains coming into Bangkok were jam packed though. That time of the day. The train slowly made it&amp;rsquo;s way through Bangkok. There were frequent stops at stations or otherwise. There was a wind through the window every time the train moved and it helped me drift off to sleep. After Don Muang, the train ran at a consistent pace and we were in Ayutthaya by 8:35 AM. I was not up to walking the three odd kilometers to the hostel so I entertained a &lt;em&gt;tuk-tuk&lt;/em&gt; driver who took me to the hostel for 80 THB. Ayutthaya seemed like a pretty laid back place from the back seat of the &lt;em&gt;tuk-tuk&lt;/em&gt;. It had wide roads at right angles and not too many people or vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/8/7389/27577392861_ab638107d1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ayyuthaya-tuk-tuk-scene&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Ayutthaya from the back of a tuk-tuk&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;wandering-in-the-lazy-town&#34;&gt;Wandering in the Lazy Town&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hostel was probably the coolest one I have been to yet. There was a lot of random stuff all around and the decor was something of a chic - antique setting (to borrow the term from one of the reviews I had read). The check in time was at 1 PM but I was offered a place to put away my luggage and the common bathroom to freshen up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat a while in the hostel and then left to wander as usual. I made a rough plan on a map and then disregarded it, as always. I walked past the museum and the temples. I was in no mood to pay and watch something so redundant. Dao had already given me an idea of what to expect. Golden Buddhas sitting inside gaudy temples. No thank you! I walked along the riverside till I reached a market. I went into the market and examined the produce on sale. Fresh fishes, barbecued ones, sandals, vegetables, etc. I got out from the opposite end. People looked at me with curiosity and were quick to smile when I caught their gaze. I was already liking Ayutthaya. There were few people, fewer tourists and the locals were warm and welcoming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Scenes from the market&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I wandered around, I started thinking why people did not wander much. It is so much fun to explore the unknown lanes of a new place. There are unexpected relics, waving children, barking dogs, exquisite food and what not! I never quite understand the fun people find in sticking to the &amp;ldquo;tourist area&amp;rdquo;. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a sense of familiarity and convenience that keeps them there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Wandering around Ayutthaya&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I picked up some charcoal grilled chicken (&lt;em&gt;kai tod&lt;/em&gt;) and ate it with relish as I walked back to the hostel. Even the food was cheap here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEA Tip #4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Northern Thailand is cheaper than Southern Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back to the hostel and checked in. My bed was not quite ready so I sat in the common room listening to blues and jazz play on JBL speakers. I sat reading the book a while and then took the map and headed out again. This time I went in the direction of the main temples but I was still not in the mood to pay for my entrance. The sun was out and the weather had become hotter. I walked around the temples and saw some beautiful green stretches between them. This city gave me a feel of Anuradhapura. There were beautiful parks and the temples were not crowded together like it was in Bagan. I was half expecting this place to be like Bagan by the way, but thankfully it wasn&amp;rsquo;t. The temples had low walls so despite not paying the fee, I was able to see most of them by just walking around them. They were quite beautiful and oozing with history, but it was the parks that I really fell in love with. They had these small ponds and lakes and lots of birds. I felt like going for a run which I planned on doing every single morning but those plans were never executed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ayutthaya&amp;rsquo;s main city is full of &lt;em&gt;wats&lt;/em&gt; (temples) and the region is quite well preserved. No new buildings encroach the land and the city has spread out far from these relics. The Buddhas in the &lt;em&gt;wats&lt;/em&gt; curiously have their heads cut. Apparently these heads were cut off and sold to private collectors in the western market. The temples are a curious mix of Hindu and Buddhist structures. There are the bell shaped pagodas and the phallic &lt;em&gt;shikhars&lt;/em&gt; of temples to be seen together in the same complex. It reminded me of a recent article that I had read about the spread of Indian culture in south-east Asia. Even the name Ayutthaya is derived from the capital of Ram Rajya : Ayodhya.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Wat Ratburana&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I returned to the hostel to take a bath and do some laundry. I have discovered that regular laundry helps me get through the task faster and easier than making a pile and dealing with it all at once. Also, I have been slowly growing appalled at my bag&amp;rsquo;s contents. I used to be somewhat proud of my packing skills. No more. I ended up leaving my sandals and slippers in this hostel. No point carrying them around if I am not going to use it. The new &amp;ldquo;Aquashoes&amp;rdquo; that I had picked up seemed to be doing really well. I will be dropping more stuff further in the trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;creepy-crawlies&#34;&gt;Creepy Crawlies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran into a traveller&amp;rsquo;s nightmare : bed bugs. I was dead tired when I went to bed that night, having had travelled all the way from Koh Tao and had gotten an excuse for a sleep in the bus to Bangkok. But as soon as I put out the lights, I started itching. I saw one on the white bed sheet and killed it. Then I remembered that I had seen the hostel staff fumigating my bed earlier in the afternoon. Goddammit! I went down and got myself shifted to another dorm. I also took a hot water bath and washed my clothes in boiling water. I stayed up for a while to see if this one had bugs. It did. I killed two and then tried sleeping with the blanket below me, a technique that had saved me in Baijnath. I woke up the next day with more bites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was ravaged and sleep deprived. I was fixing myself some toasts for breakfast when Poon, the manager of the hostel came up to me and apologised for the bugs. He offered to refund a night&amp;rsquo;s worth but I just asked for a clean bed instead. He told me how he had to close the hostel for a month a while earlier to deal with the bugs. Now they were making a reappearance. It&amp;rsquo;s not exactly the hostel&amp;rsquo;s fault that there are bugs. Bed bugs have nothing to do with cleanliness. They spread by infesting luggage of travellers and hitching a ride to the next destination. I decided to give the place another night before deciding whether to get out or not. I took another scalding hot shower to rid myself of any bugs. But it&amp;rsquo;s never simple once you have been bitten. You feel them even when there is nothing on your skin. It&amp;rsquo;s a horror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;The otherwise super cool hostel&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;pickle-of-nostalgia&#34;&gt;Pickle of Nostalgia&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had some excellent noodle soup for lunch and then walked around like the day before. My camera&amp;rsquo;s battery died at the first temple but I pushed on. I am not a photographer, so I can always revert to mobile or no photography. I saw the reclining Buddha and a few other temples. Most of the ruins don&amp;rsquo;t have an entrance fee. It is just the more popular ones that charge a small fee. I completed most of the old city on foot today. There was not much left anyway so it was a shorter walk than the day before. On the way back I saw &lt;em&gt;Ganesha&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Saraswati&lt;/em&gt; idols, amongst others, kept under a tree. Hinduism was definitely alive in this city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was walking back to the hostel, I saw something that made me double back. I expressed my desire to taste the edible and the elderly lady who was sitting at the stall offered me a piece. Yes! This was what I had thought it was : &lt;em&gt;ber ka achaar&lt;/em&gt; or wild berry pickle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7502/27072238463_c2fd7c2c4b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ber-ka-achaar-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Ber ka Achaar!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to have it as a kid when I went to my grandmother&amp;rsquo;s place in Tatanagar. I bought a small pack from her, must have been 250 grams or so. Then I went to the &lt;strong&gt;Phra Ram Park&lt;/strong&gt; and found a nice spot in front of the lake to sit down and enjoy the packet of pickle. Three school girls sat at a distance, probably bunking school. I ate every piece with relish, recalling random memories of my childhood. I used to sneak into the store room to steal the &lt;em&gt;achaar&lt;/em&gt;. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember who my accomplice used to be? Kunal Bhaiya? Kanika Didi? Why did Ma and Nani stop making these? I think it was too much effort. My mouth was scraped by the seeds and I had a small pile of them in front of me. I sucked the last drop of the sweet and sour syrup from the plastic packet. I laughed when I thought of how Ma was so disapproving of eating so much of this &lt;em&gt;achaar&lt;/em&gt;. Stomach ache; heat; I did not care. I was happy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;I ate all that!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I resumed walking to the hostel. The girls had been caught by the police officers patrolling the park and been sent away. For some reason it struck me as amusing. I picked up a &amp;ldquo;Lipton Iced Tea&amp;rdquo; from Seven Eleven. I was drinking a &lt;strong&gt;LOT&lt;/strong&gt; of iced tea these days. It helped me keep myself hydrated. I could hear &amp;ldquo;Another One Bites the Dust&amp;rdquo; from outside the hostel. A pleasant change from the blues and jazz. I went inside to see that the hostel dwellers had discovered the vinyl collection. I browsed it to find some really cool albums. There was Dylan, Beatles, Queen, The Who, Clapton and more. I spent the rest of the night playing random albums and reading. I got talking with an English boy who was travelling after graduating from school. His name was Luke (hopefully not Skywalker!), Manchester United was his club and he lived a little south of Manchester. We talked about EPL, the upcoming Euro, his travel plans and mine. He was the most soft spoken English guy I have ever met. I had to strain my ears to listen to what he was saying and many a times I laughed and nodded without a clue as to what he had said!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The common room slowly cleared out and once again I was the last one to leave. A Thai guy started playing random tunes on an electric guitar. His style was nice and dreamy. I listened a while and then went to bed myself. Time to face the horror again. How I wished the bugs gone. This hostel would have been perfect otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;extension&#34;&gt;Extension&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy that I had been bitten just twice in the last night, I decided to extend the stay in this hostel. But part of the reason was that I was lazy to find another place for a couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip #8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If bugged, leave as soon as possible. That&amp;rsquo;s the only way to deal with bed bugs. Check your clothes or heat dry them as soon as you can, take hot water showers yourself and get the hell out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was drinking coffee when a Thai girl started talking to me. This was Bella and we had crossed paths last night when I spooked her out while she was going to her dorm. She was really excited that I was from India and wanted to know more about the country. She worked as a safety engineer near Ayutthaya and was also a tattoo artist. Her energy was contagious. She wanted to travel and was trying to find a reason to do so. She asked everyone their&amp;rsquo;s, hoping to find one that appealed to her. She was surprised to learn that I was married and wanted to know how it worked between me and my wife. Her boyfriend was dominant and possessive and did not like her going out. I guess Thailand was similar to India in this regard. We talked for a bit and she taught me some Thai words. She also told me a place to go eat and I went there with Luke to grab a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That particular place had sold out it&amp;rsquo;s stock though. So we sat at the noodle soup place and had a bowl each of delicious noodle soup. We talked about the English economy and how easy or difficult it was to find a job there. Luke was going to be the fourth generation of his family in the company that he was going to join. I told him about my drifting in the Indian startup scene. He had his apprehensions about this way of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luke and I went exploring the town together later that afternoon. We rented out a couple of bicycles and went towards one of the spots that looked interesting on the map. We cycled through some pretty roads with a lake on one side. Then we got to the first stop, a very European looking memorial of some crocodile slaying and shark fighting king (&lt;strong&gt;Monument of King Naresuan the Great&lt;/strong&gt;). It would be interesting to read his legend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7427/27373007440_0498a6bc5e.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;biking-king-naresuan-5&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Crocodile slaying King Naresuan the Great&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a stupa (&lt;strong&gt;Wat Phu Khao Thong&lt;/strong&gt;) right next to it and we climbed up it&amp;rsquo;s steep stairs. A light wind was blowing and a mullah was calling out for evening prayers from somewhere close by. Both of these soothed our tired mind and body and we stood on the top level for a few minutes. There was a door open to what seemed like the inner chamber of the stupa and we went inside. I did not even know that stupas had an inner chamber! The inside was a small heavily decorated room with idols and banners. I came out quickly because it was really hot and stuffy inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/8/7283/27651074125_efdcbafffa.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;biking-stupa-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Wat Phu Khao Thong&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Inner chamber&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final destination that I had in mind was &lt;strong&gt;Queen Si Suriyothai Memorial&lt;/strong&gt;. The road till was a pretty uncrowded one that was lined with green paddy fields and small rustic huts. The ride in itself was quite enjoyable and the memorial looked exquisite! It was flanked by a lake on one side and a European style boulevard on the other. We had approached the Memorial from the behind, in my usual style, and went around the encircling road. I spotted a dragon lizard (water monitor) and tried to follow it for a better view but the shy creature slid into the lake when I got too near. Luke seemed to be enjoying this little adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7301/27651067115_fb5184dca9.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;biking-14&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Beautiful roads make for a happy ride&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Dragon Lizard!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went around to the front of the memorial. A biking gang was clicking selfies and a few more people were celebrating the day out. But there was no foreign tourist there other than the two of us. It seemed extremely weird that people did not make even this small an effort to get to such a gem of a place. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s true what they say about the &amp;ldquo;backpackers&amp;rdquo;. They are all following the same beaten path, one after the other, living in the echo chamber of reviews and travel books.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Beautiful setting&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made a small stop at &lt;strong&gt;Wat Lokayasutharam&lt;/strong&gt; to see the reclining Buddha before heading back to the hostel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7344/27372939380_6b4fc60353.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;biking-rec-buddha-3&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Buddha be chill&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat in the common room after taking yet another bath. I read for a while and then bid Luke goodbye before heading out to hunt for food. Luke had his train to Chiang Mai in a bit. I ended up at the riverside market opposite to the museum that I had seen on the first day. The place was really lively at night. There were sea food stalls that I skipped. I ate some pork sausages that were passable and a Roti Mataba at a Muslim stall. It as more or less a Mughlai Parantha. I topped it with some iced tea. All for 90 THB!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7394/27651026305_f181b755bc.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;night-market-6&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Roti Mataba&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the hostel I watched &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3460252/&#34;&gt;The Hateful Eight&lt;/a&gt; with one of the guys from the hostel staff. The volume was a problem for some of the people sitting in the common room and I had to repeat some of the dialogues out of memory. When I hit the bunk, someone in the room, probably the one below me, started snoring really loud. I somehow managed to sleep, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abrupt-ending&#34;&gt;Abrupt Ending&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was not bitten during the night, at least none that I could make out. But I woke up to one of the girls talking on her phone with her parents. They were trying to figure out whether there were bugs in her bed or not. I later saw that her entire leg was covered with bites. Anyway, the three guys in the dorm apart from her (myself included) assured her that there were bugs and she freaked out some more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went out to the balcony and saw that the sun was out. It had been an overcast few days thus far. That was when I suddenly decided to end my stay in Ayutthaya. I unpacked my luggage and inspected it thoroughly. I also went along the seams of the bag. Then I repacked everything and went to take another bath. Once I was done, I checked out and returned the bicycle. I managed to grab a bite at the chicken and rice joint that Bella had suggested the previous day. It was really good! Then I picked up my luggage and got out of the hostel. It had been a weird stay and I can still not make up my mind whether I loved it or dreaded it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/8/7375/27040944333_e18626dc74.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;chicken-rice&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Bella&#39;s recommendation üëç&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could not find a &lt;em&gt;tuk-tuk&lt;/em&gt; so I started walking. After a while, one stopped and picked me up. It already had two women inside. They were French and this was the day that I learnt that Quechua is a French company and not Brazilian as I had previously imagined. One of the girls had been in Thailand for six months now, teaching English in villages along the Myanmar border. The two were travelling eastward. I talked to them till it was time for their train. Mine was in another half hour. I managed to consume another glass of iced tea in that duration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My rating: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1594044070&#34;&gt;2 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I had sworn off Ghosh for good. But an uncle (the same one who had lent me his copy of &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/215678.In_an_Antique_Land&#34;&gt;In An Antique Land&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;) told me to pick this book since I was about to go to Burma. With a rather divided mind I eventually got a kindle version of this book and started reading it a few days prior to my departure to the &amp;ldquo;Land of Gold&amp;rdquo;. The reading continued well into the trip and I finally finished during a train journey to the northern state of Kachin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is definitely one of Ghosh&amp;rsquo;s better works. It tells the rags-to-riches-and-back story of a certain Indian boy who made it big in Burma. It was partially in line with Haley&amp;rsquo;s Roots. The exile of the last king and queen of Burma was worked in quite well. The trouble : there was a lack of something pivotal in the story. The protagonist lost center stage at times and while other characters tried gaining focus, they were pushed back into obscurity before they could make their presence felt. It seemed a rather hastened narration of fictionalized history. All this rendered the book rather dry and, had the purpose been so, didactic. Ghosh could have done much better with this story. His research is very evident and the way he has managed to make a story of all the historical events is also very impressive. If only the story-telling had been up to the mark, this book would have been a delight. For me, however, the history of Queen Supayalat and King Thibaw and their palace in Mandalay was a delightful knowledge when I actually saw their effigies in the Mandalay Palace. In a certain way I could relate to the palace through Ghosh&amp;rsquo;s words, for which I shall ever remain thankful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rajkumar Raha, the protagonist of the story, is a young boy who finds himself in Mandalay when the English defeat the Burmese kingdom and make it a part of the Empire. While the king and queen are being exiled, he sees a strikingly beautiful girl, Dolly, in the queen&amp;rsquo;s entourage and falls in love with her. Years later Rajkumar is wiser and has made a fortune for himself in the Burmese wood industry. He seeks out Dolly in Ratnagiri, asks for her hand in marriage and takes her back to Yangon. The story follows their lives and the lives of the next two generations of their family and the ones closely associated with theirs. In the background take place the Great War and the age of rubber plantations, World War II, Japanese invasion of Malaya and Burma, the struggle for independence of India and Burma, and even the modern usurping of power by the military junta and the struggle for democracy by Aung San Suu Kyi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am not sure whether I enjoyed this book or not. Apart from it&amp;rsquo;s dryness I cannot really find any fault in this one (as opposed to &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://bookedvorm.blogspot.in/2010/10/calcutta-chromosome-amitav-ghosh.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&gt;The Calcutta Chromosome&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;). Ghosh&amp;rsquo;s forte remains his research. I still find his storytelling not compatible with my palate. Unless there is another strong recommendation, I would not bother picking up Ghosh&amp;rsquo;s work proactively.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>

&lt;p&gt;Parul and I decided to visit Burma / Myanmar for a vacation in late February 2016. We ended up getting three full weeks to travel the beautiful country. In a country like Myanmar that has a rapidly evolving tourism industry, I intend to fill the gaps that I found while trying to plan a trip myself. That and a first hand narrative of the wonderful experiences that we have had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is for the second leg of travel - Mandalay (2 Mar 2016 - 5 Mar 2016).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;irrawaddy-river-cruise&#34;&gt;Irrawaddy River Cruise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We checked out really early the next morning and the cab was waiting for us by the time we got downstairs. It was a rather short ride to the jetty and hardly worth the money that we paid for. Could have easily walked the distance in 30 minutes or so. There were two boats docked at the jetty. A man checked our tickets and pointed to the smaller of the two. The few passengers we could see were on the bigger one. Parul was apprehensive that she would be able to cross the wooden plank to the boat without falling while I was dreading that the boat ride would be a repetition of our &lt;em&gt;shared&lt;/em&gt; cab to Mount Popa. Both of us were in the wrong though. Parul made it to the boat without incident and we knew that we had more travellers on the boat when we dumped our luggage on a pile of bags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were not many though. Apart from the two of us there was a group of three Dutch travellers, one man and two women. We were joined by another female before the boat departed. All the travellers other than us were a little advanced in years. I would have put them in their early sixties. Myanmar seemed to be a place where you could see a considerable percentage of older travellers. I think it was because of the romance of the place that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wolverton-mountain.com/articles/on_the_road_to_mandalay.html&#34;&gt;Kipling&amp;rsquo;s poem&lt;/a&gt; had created in that generation. Or maybe it was because what the country had to offer. The neighbouring countries held more charm for the younger population, though we did find a lot of them as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the boats started off in quick succession, the other boat (MGRG) a couple of minutes before ours (Malikha). There seemed to be more people on board the MGRG boat. Once again, it was a difference that online presence had made. Malikha was comfortable enough; had a nice deck, reasonable food options, clean toilet, enough seats to sit or sleep in. Though I suppose MGRG had more amenities, there was a considerable price difference as well. Malikha had cost us 30 USD while MGRG was more than 40.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg borderedimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Early morning departure&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An orange glow on the eastern sky announced the spot that the sun would come up. The sceneries were quite amazing. The sky was somewhat cloudy but it did not blotch the beauty of the sunrise. Since Parul was taking pictures, I realised that this was one of those rare occasions when I could actually enjoy living the moment rather than spending time capturing it. It has become a compulsive habit that I am not too fond of. The story that plays in my mind demands pictures, and so, as if by reflex, I pull out my phone and start clicking. I sat down and enjoyed the wind. We were cruising comfortably at about 15 kmph. The river&amp;rsquo;s dark waters brightened. It was a calm and steady surface broken only in the wake of the two boats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg borderedimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Sun rising over the Irrawaddy&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moon had not yet vanished from the sky when the orange glow turned to a shade of red and there appeared a circular embodiment of the light. Small birds, the species of which I am unaware of, were flying along the surface of the river, possibly looking for a morning snack. Fishing boats had started plying over the Irrawaddy. The river had come alive! Both of us thought that this one was better than the one we had seen a couple of days ago from the crowded Bulethi Pagoda in Bagan. If not for the continuous hum of the boat&amp;rsquo;s engine, it might even have been one of the best settings that I have been a part of in my life!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fell asleep on the deck and had a comfortable three hour sleep. The cold wind and warm sun were striking a perfect balance. Eventually the sun grew hotter and I moved indoors to less lazy activities like reading and writing. The Innwa bridge came into sight around 3:30 PM announcing Mandalay&amp;rsquo;s approach. The pagodas of Sagaing came into view and within another hour our boat had reached the jetty and we were picking our luggage and thanking the staff before deboarding the boat. The old folk took a taxi while we decided to walk the four odd kilometers to the Hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1600/25398218673_45565ddc85.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Innwa Bridge&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Innwa Bridge and the pagodas of Sagaing&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That night we started exploring the amazing food scene in Mandalay. We went to a famous Shan food place a little far away, Golden Shan. It was supposed to be a typical Shan buffet but by 9:30 PM some of the dishes were already gone. The food was pretty good though. We had seen a &amp;ldquo;Dagon Beer Station&amp;rdquo; on the way and thought we would hang around a bit before heading back to the hotel. But by the time we were returning, even that had shut down! Mandalay slept early as well. We were expecting different from the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ancient-capital-region&#34;&gt;Ancient Capital Region&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a decent hotel in Mandalay. It was a tad bit expensive but that was to be expected of a city. Weirdly, we could not find any listings of hostels in Mandalay. The one that was listed was offering extremely expensive dorm beds. Perhaps the hostel culture has not yet invaded the country despite the tourism boom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had decided to cover the more distant parts of Mandalay on the first day. These were places of historical significance like &lt;strong&gt;Mingun, Sagaing and Amarapura&lt;/strong&gt;. They were spread out across the two banks of the Irrawaddy. We were on the eastern side of the river. Mingun and Sagaing happen to be bang on the opposite side. There are a couple of daily ferries that ply between Mandalay and Mingun, allowing tourists a decent enough time to explore the ruins of the old town and then return to Mandalay. But we decided to rent out a bike instead and explore on our own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bike that the hotel arranged for us was something of a novelty for me. It was a clutch-less geared system. It took me a while to figure out how it worked. And all the time I had a feeling that I was doing something horribly wrong; that I was mistreating the engine by changing gears without a clutch. But this was the vehicle of choice in the city and everyone was riding it in a similar manner. Almost immediately after leaving our hotel, the bike stuttered to a stop and refused to start. While I frantically tried the ignition and the kick start, a man walked up to me to indicate that the bike was out of fuel. Great! Mandalay&amp;rsquo;s road side fuel sales came to the rescue and we were finally off to Mingun. We refueled once more at an actual petrol pump on the way to find out that the price difference between road side and pump fuel was almost 80%! Or maybe it was just standard tourist price that we had paid for the bottle of petrol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;mingun&#34;&gt;Mingun&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mingun is to the west of the Irrawaddy and to get there from Mandalay you need to go south, cross the Mandalay bridge to Sagaing and then head north along the river to Mingun. The road till Sagaing was a nice and broad one with heavy traffic and toll collections. It was nothing exceptional in any way. But once we took the river side road from Sagaing, things got interesting. Past the town, the road winded through small hamlets scattered on the roadside. Untamed countryside went past us with its hues of brown and green. There was little greenery this time of the year since it was the dry season. The rural landscapes were quite similar to what we are accustomed to back in India. The only difference being the numbers. I think that is, in essence, what differentiates Myanmar from India. This country seemed a less crowded version of our own. The roads and landscapes were similar; the daily engagements of people were familiar; the food was awesome; the people were friendly, easily intrigued by foreigners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the villages that we passed had a rather elaborate &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinbyu&#34;&gt;Shinbyu ceremony&lt;/a&gt; going on. We stopped our bike and walked up to the crowd of people clogging the narrow street. There were pick up trucks lined on one side, to be stuffed with the crowd that was celebrating on the street. The boys who were to be initiated into monkhood sat decorated on plastic chairs with a nonchalant attitude to the hullabaloo around them. The families celebrated with zest! A dancing troupe with tribal getup was dancing to English numbers from 2010; Pitbull, Jeniffer Lopez and Shakira.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg borderedimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1575/25907236292_ffdfea7670.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Shaking a leg to Pitbull&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Shaking a leg to Pitbull&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the striking mismatch between the sound and the getup, they seemed to be all well coordinated and danced rather well. The villagers stood around, some watching in amusement while a few inebriated men danced along in less coordinated steps. Their wives ran around collecting them when they got too close to interrupting the professionals and they simply continued dancing wherever they were left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg vertimg borderedimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1540/25933244251_d1ac563a42.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Skit at Shinbyu&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Villagers enjoying a musical skit&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the tribal dance, we were treated to a musical skit. It seemed to be about the tussle between a man and a woman, seemingly lovers. In the typical fashion of rural sense of amusement, it got a little lewd but entertaining nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/140507143@N02/25727269520/in/album-72157664017913913/&#34; title=&#34;mingun-shinbyu-low&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1443/25727269520_e4bb00c242.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;mingun-shinbyu-low&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Shinbyu celebrations&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another very evidently drunk man offered us watermelon slices as we stood watching the ceremony. I took one in order not to be rude. He would demand money for it later but a rebuke from his wife would make him hasten to return me the money I offered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip #3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drunk men are simply drunk men, no matter where you are. Stay clear or deal politely, latter being more amusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had spent close to half an hour watching the ceremony before we decided to get going. We had come only half of the 40 odd kilometers between Mandalay and Mingun. We rushed on the well tarred roads and after passing some more pretty villages, reached the spot along the Irrawaddy that was chosen for one of the most ambitious projects in the world. We bought tickets to for the Mingun-Sagaing region (worth 5000 MMK) from one of the counters and went further to check out the stupas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parul also bought one of those conical cane hats that she had been fancying for a while and went into the next level of her Burmese mode. She liked to believe that she was &lt;a href=&#34;http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/kungfupanda/images/e/ea/Dream_po.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150830221231&#34;&gt;Po&lt;/a&gt; but then who doesn&amp;rsquo;t!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1567/25933246511_0152d12460.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Parul : Burmese Level 2&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Parul : Burmese Level 2&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mingun_Pahtodawgyi&#34;&gt;Pathodawgyi&lt;/a&gt; is a remarkable sight. It was intended to be a 150 meters tall stupa with two massive lions sitting on the eastern entrance. Due to a prophecy that the king would die when the stupa was completed, the project was abandoned and stands as an incomplete reminder of the grandeur and superstition of yore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg borderedimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1622/25933246471_aeb5ebbf95.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Imposing Pathodawgyi&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Imposing Pathodawgyi&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We walked around its compound, straining our eyes to see the cracked walls of the monument in the blazing sunlight. The immense stupa had been ravaged by the earthquakes of 1839 and much of the structure had cracked or collapsed. Wilderness laid claim to portions of the monument with tall grasses and bushes growing out of cracks in the ground and the building. Parul even saw (and I heard) a snake slither past near where we were. By her description, it was green rat snake. We tried finding it again but it had run away into hiding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1632/25395229874_d937ee4871.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Selfie in the blazing sun&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Selfie in the blazing sun&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A warning said that climbing up the stupa was dangerous but since there was a proper staircase built, we decided to climb up all the same. The bricked surface of the monument was scorching and we tried finding respite in any shaded spot that we could find. At the top of the stairs a group of boys were idling around smoking cheroots. They &lt;em&gt;mingalabar&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lsquo;ed us as we passed and asked if we could get a few pictures clicked with them. We obliged with a laugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects of the earthquake were much more evident up top. The entire surface was broken up and had collapsed into itself. Bushes grew out of every crack that afforded enough space. We walked to one of the ends (northern one) and took in the view. It was quite a vantage point and we could see the nearby lands sprawling around. The Mingun Bell and Hsinphyumae Pagoda lay to the north.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1471/25933245001_b7d8962b16.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;View from up top&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;View from up top&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did not bother with the rest of the sides as the heat was getting unbearable. We carefully found our way down the stairs and went back to collect our shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went and saw the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mingun_Bell&#34;&gt;Mingun Bell&lt;/a&gt; next. This massive bell is more than 90 tonnes in weight and rings when it is struck. It was meant to go with the huge stupa next to it but when the Pathodawgyi was abandoned, the bell slowly passed into delinquency. We spent a few minutes playing around it. There were a lot of people, tourists and locals alike, clicking pictures and hitting the surface with wooden pieces to make the bell ring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg vertimg borderedimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1626/25933242501_8f626e35cc.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Mingun Bell&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Mingun Bell&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next to the bell was the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hsinbyume_Pagoda&#34;&gt;Hsinphyumae Pagoda&lt;/a&gt;. It is a white pagoda which is built in a very different style from the other pagodas. The terraces represent the mountain ranges going up to Mont Meru. The view from up top was nothing exceptional; we had seen a better view from the Pathodawgyi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg borderedimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Hsinphyumae Pagoda&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent some time loitering around and clicking pictures and then went down to get our scooter and headed back towards Sagaing. On the way we stopped at a place for lunch. They were not serving food for some reason. We could not understand why but maybe it was because of the time, too late of too early. They did have some really awesome coconut buns though. We ate a plate of those and they filled us up enough to survive till the evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1681/25907238382_b3c8176bde.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Delicious coconut buns!&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Delicious coconut buns!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;innwa&#34;&gt;Innwa&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to skip Sagaing. We had had our fill of pagodas and stupas in Bagan. We decided to go to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inwa&#34;&gt;Innwa&lt;/a&gt; instead. Innwa was the ancient capital of Burmese kingdoms from the 16th to 19th centuries. The earthquake of 1839 (the same one that cracked the Pathodawgyi) completely destroyed the place and the capital was then shifted to Amarapura. We biked back to Sagaing and then took the Innwa bridge to the east of the river. This time we headed south and came across a stream. The ruins of Innwa lay on the other side of this stream. There was a boat service that offered to take us and the bike for a reasonable return fee of 1000 MMK per person/bike. The other option for seeing Innwa was to rent a horse cart on the other side. We thought about the proposition for a bit and decided to take the horse cart. Parul had been fascinated by it since Bagan and this would be a place as good as any to try it out. We bought two return tickets and boarded the boat with a few other tourists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the minute we were at the other side of the small stream. We got off the boat and our place was taken by other tourists returning from their tour of the ancient capital. We walked on ahead and there appeared a big &amp;ldquo;horse cart stand&amp;rdquo; with many drivers offering to take the new tourists out to tour Innwa. They said that seeing the place would take four hours on foot and two hours by the cart. The cart would take us to four main spots. Since we had already decided to take the cart, we quickly booked one for the price of 5000 MMK per person. The horse cart set out down the dusty path through the lanes of Innwa.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Horsecart ride in Innwa&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Innwa seemed like a forgotten part of history. There was a small village in place of what must have been a bustling capital. The road from the boat jetty to the walled city was a dusty one. The horse trotted at ease, the driver not hastening it for speed. Somehow the cart seemed to fit right in with the surroundings. It seemed but natural to be seeing a place as antique as Innwa in a mode of commutation as outdated as the horse cart. We came upon the gate of the walled city at length and were greeted by a narrow tarred road. The driver turned the cart along the road, leaving behind the gate. Confused, I asked him why we had not entered the gate and he told me in the broken English that he could muster that he was taking us to a pagoda that was ahead. Now this was something that I found rather disappointing. Had we been on our own, we would have stopped at places, checked out the boards telling about the history of the place. The lack of this freedom was why guided tours sucked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We crossed the southern length of the walls, going further eastward and then turned south for the first stop : &lt;strong&gt;Yadana Hsimi Pagoda&lt;/strong&gt;. This was a pagoda in ruins with not much to see. The derelict Buddha statues and the worn our bricks of the pagodas looked quite different from the gold coated statues that we had seen thus far. A huge tree south eastern corner of the compound added to the authenticity of the ruins. We walked around for five minutes and then went back to the horse cart. At this rate, we would be done in less than two hours. Hiring the cart did not seem like a good decision anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next site, however, changed our opinion a bit. This was the &lt;strong&gt;Bagaya Monastery&lt;/strong&gt;. We were asked to purchase tickets here. This 10,000 MMK ticket was for the Mandalay archaeological zone and would take care of Amarapura and Mandalay Palace as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myanmar Tip #3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always carry a good amount of cash on you when you go for sightseeing or are entering a new town. You never know when you might be asked to purchase a ticket, and they are rarely cheap!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The monastery was made of teak wood, in a fashion rather similar to other monasteries that we had and would see. It was raised on stilts and a description said that the biggest teak pillar was 60 feet in height! We walked around the underside of the monastery to inspect the teak pillars, all of which were pretty wide. Then we went up the flight of stairs to the monastery and were quite blown away by the beauty of the wood work. Both, the outside and the inside of the monastery contained some exceptionally well done wood carving. I knew that Burma was the land of teak but this kind of craftsmanship in wood was unparalleled in what I had seen till date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took our time walking around the monastery building, taking pictures and enjoying the beauty of teakwood. I saw a few monks around, each partaking in some chore related to the monastery. Though it did not seem like an active monastery, there was probably one in the surrounding buildings. Or maybe the monks came around to help in the upkeep of the building. When we left the building, it seemed that the tour might take the two hours after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We rode back to the walled city in the horse cart, entering it from the western gate. At the gate we had departed from the tarred road once again and the horse ambled on the dusty path again. An occasional house presented itself between the farmlands. We did not cross any structure reminiscent of the former glory of the capital. In a distance we could see the &lt;strong&gt;Nanmyin Tower&lt;/strong&gt;, a knocked up watchtower that was the sole survivor of the royal palace of Innwa. Everything else had been flattened by the earthquake. We rode past the watchtower, pausing momentarily to read the history and take a few photos. Climbing the tower was prohibited since the staircase (and probably the tower) was no longer in a state to take strain of tourists.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Nanmyin Tower&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We rode on to the &lt;strong&gt;Maha Aungmye Bonzan Monastery&lt;/strong&gt; nearby. It was also called the &amp;ldquo;brick monastery&amp;rdquo; because the brick architecture that set it apart from the other wooden monasteries. This one did not have exquisite artwork of Bagaya Monastery but it looked impressive in its own sense. The building was huge and built to replicate the wooden monasteries. The yellow complexion of the structure lent a beauty to it that was highlighted by the mellowing sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took a quick tour of this monastery and then returned with the horse cart to the stream crossing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;u-pain-bridge&#34;&gt;U Pain Bridge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a little time to sunset and there was a bleak chance that we might make it to Amarapura in time. We hopped on the bike and raced to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U_Bein_Bridge&#34;&gt;U Pain Bridge&lt;/a&gt; as was marked on Google Maps. We crossed a gathering of people watching a live football match but regretfully could not stop because we were planning to be done with the bridge that day. As we left the highway to take the bylanes of Amarapura, the scene grew less rushed. Groups of men played &lt;em&gt;chinlone&lt;/em&gt; every few meters while some people were wrapping up the day&amp;rsquo;s work. Sunset marked the end of the working day for the people of Burma. They believed in leading a fulfilling life rather than slogging all day long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reached the U Pain bridge a little later than what we had planned. All that remained of the sun was a bleak afterglow, but the cloudy sky had rent the setting sun invisible anyway. There were a lot of people on and around the bridge. Some were very clearly tourists or jaywalkers. Others seemed to be walking on the bridge as a matter of daily routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were at the western end of the bridge that sported a pagoda and a lively bazaar. This was clearly the place where tourists came to see the bridge. We went down to the banks of the lake first. People were taking boat rides in the lake. The water looked unclean but that was to be expected with so many people. We clicked a few shots which came out rather well. There was an awful lot of thrash all around though that was difficult to ignore. The lake did not smell however. We also saw a photo shoot going on; a model dressed in white and black being pictured on top of a dead tree trunk. Must have made a rather weird picture for what seemed to be the name of a chic magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Thrash all around the bridge&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it got darker, we climbed on the bridge and decided to walk it&amp;rsquo;s length and back. U Pain Bridge is considered to be the world&amp;rsquo;s longest teak bridge at a length of 1.2 kilometers. It is quite amazing to behold. The wood of the bridge looks in good shape despite it&amp;rsquo;s age (it was built around 1850). It sways a little under the incomprehensible weight that it is subjected to but it does not seem weak in any way. There are small resting points built all along the way, small benches and shades to rest a while or enjoy the view. It was all dark when we were up on it and there was no view to enjoy. There was barely a breeze blowing and the mosquitoes started bothering the minute one stopped. We crossed a few resto-bars built on the lake&amp;rsquo;s surface which seemed like a nice place to stop for a beer or two. But perhaps when the weather is less oppressive and the evening younger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We bought a lighter on the other side of the bridge and walked back smoking a cheroot that we had acquired earlier that day. We somehow consumed half of it and left the rest. It seemed like an extremely large beedi. A shorter one would have been appreciated but such a large one was too tasteless and seemed to be a pointless exercise. Yet everywhere you looked in Myanmar, there were people smoking these abominations and chewing beetle. The nation was consumed by these products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two and a half liters of petrol that we had filled the machine with were not even half consumed after the day&amp;rsquo;s trip. We were already pissed that the hotel had given us such a run down machine and no petrol for such an extravagant price. We decided to ride around the Mandalay Palace a couple of times before returning the bike. The palace looked eerily beautiful lit up in the night. The moat reflected the watch towers beautifully. On the southern wall there was a light and music show going on with fountains and all. Locals and tourists were to be seen leaning on the railings watching the amusing show. We saw a few vehicles going inside the palace gate and decided to go check it out. A military officer stopped us hurriedly as we approached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;We weren&amp;rsquo;t allowed by this gate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which gate then? The man pointed to his left. East gate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes. East.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;But the palace is closed now. Tomorrow morning. 8 AM to 5 PM.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah. Okay. We smiled and rode back to the main road. Laughing that he might have been laughing at us. Stupid tourists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;cycling-in-mandalay&#34;&gt;Cycling in Mandalay&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went to see the Mandalay Palace the next day. We got up and had the awesome breakfast that the hotel was offering us for free. Then we got bicycles from the hotel. We did not have a huge distance to cover and it seemed like a more reasonable option than renting out the motorbike again. The bicycles, however, were just as run down as the motorcycle had been but we managed somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ticket we had bought the previous day worked at Mandalay Palace. The inside of the palace is all restricted area except for the central palace. We rode past training grounds and lodgings. It seemed a curious sight. We rode around the main palace and entered it from the western gate. Going opposite to the usual flow would remain a recurring thing in our sightseeing. From this side, we hit upon the Palace museum first. We looked at the relics and exhibits for a while and then went around the palace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg borderedimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Palace quarters&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As opposed to the outside of the main palace, the inside was free to move. There was no guard or military man restricting your movement. You could go anywhere that the doors were open. Signs warned you where shoes were to be taken off; banners described buildings; the watch tower offered an amazing view of the palace.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;View from the watchtower&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We walked around for a bit and clicked photos, accidentally walked in on couples having a private time in the backyard of the queen&amp;rsquo;s maids&amp;rsquo; quarters, selected the most suitable quarter for residence, imagined and envied the daily routine of the royal family. Then we got a couple of glasses of sugarcane juice and pedaled out of the palace the same way we had come in. A couple of hours was all that was required for the palace and we had spent that much time here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg borderedimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Funny?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sun was bright and harsh by now. We went to the Mandalay hill and parked our bikes next to the staircase. This was one of those few places where you had to pay to store your shoes. We did and started walking up the stairs. There were quite a few pagodas all along the staircase to the top. Parul&amp;rsquo;s research had told us that there was one pagoda worth seeing, the &lt;strong&gt;Kusinara Pagoda&lt;/strong&gt;. This was also supposedly a little difficult to find. After the second flight of steps, there was a board with vague letterings declaring Kusinara on the left. That wasn&amp;rsquo;t so difficult to find! The stairs to the left led down again and almost at the base level we hit upon a gate that led into a room with golden leaves, owls and lizards painted on white walls. The colour combination looked very different because of the staccato bursts in which the colours came. A wooden Buddha face looked on with a mix of ecstasy and knowledge on his face. Another door led us to the inner chamber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg borderedimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Wooden Buddha&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The walls continued the same pattern but the corridoors were now arches. The floor was tiled with brown swastikas and the lamps shed a very becoming yellow light in the room. We walked in and to our right a Buddha statue was doing what seemed to be the best thing to do in such a setting; lay down and rest your head on your arm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg borderedimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Reclining Buddha at Kusinara pagoda&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sat down under a fan and decided to enjoy the coolness of the room. The sun had been harsh and hot outside. Kusinara offered us a much needed respite. There was no one else around. Just two young girls who practiced their English on us. They asked us our names and country. Told us their&amp;rsquo;s. When I asked, they explained that the school was off for the summers, which was why they were running around in this place. They were quite fascinated by Parul&amp;rsquo;s thanaka.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Burmese kids&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talked to them and clicked a few photographs for the next ten to fifteen minutes. Then we decided it was time to get off our lazy asses and continue the climb to the top of the hill. As we were leaving, a few more tourists trickled in, never too many in number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We slowly climbed to the top, breaking to watch little boys attempting stunts with &lt;em&gt;chinlone&lt;/em&gt; or eating raw mangoes and drinking water. We crossed many statues and pagodas en route. Some had big Buddhas, some small; each in a different posture and stance. There was the famous statue of Buddha pointing towards Mandalay, prophesying the coming of a great city in that area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg vertimg borderedimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Prophesying Buddha&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good thing was that the entire staircase was shaded, else I doubt we would have made it to the top! The pagodas got a touch of glass work towards the top. The Buddhas were replaced by various other deities, probably survivors of older faiths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg borderedimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Glassy pagodas&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we made it to the top, we realised that it was nothing exceptional. It might have be better during sunset but in this season it was the haze that killed the view, whatever the vantage point. You could see most of Mandalay from up here. The Irrawaddy on the west was also clearly visible. To add to our frustration, we had to pay 1000 MMK for the summit! We had bought a 10000 MMK ticket for Mandalay area but the hill top demanded an extra 1000 MMK? It seemed rather ridiculous but we did not debate. We were too tired to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were approached by an Indian man. His name was Mahatma and he was third generation Burmese. His grandfather had been brought from India to work on plantations by a rich Indian landlord who had been gifted land in Burma. Since then his family had been in these parts. He was working in the jade industry now, and seemingly had come a long way from the position that his grandfather had found himself in. He was happy to meet Indians but had not visited India too often. Just four times in his life. His nephew, Abhay, had never been to India. He was there at the hill with his relatives. We were all introduced and talked a bit. He told us a little about the city and the preservation of the Hindu culture in the country. After some time we took his leave and retraced our steps down the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;With Mahatma and Abhay&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the bottom of the stairs we sat down at a small shop for some food and more sugarcane juice. The food was another &amp;ldquo;Oh my God!&amp;rdquo; instance. Our hostess filled us up with food. I had ordered beef curry and just that had a spread of 7-8 bowls! Parul had shan noodles which were pretty good again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myanmar Tip #4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always wait for your ordered dishes to be laid out before you order more. You never know how many complimentary dishes might be on the way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the awesome lunch, we grudgingly returned to our cycles that were parked across the street and slowly pedaled to the pagoda and monastery complex to the immediate south-east of the Mandalay Hill. Parul had done some research last night and found out that these were the more interesting of the pagodas in the city. It was after four and although the heat was letting up a bit, our full stomachs had dulled our enthusiasm to see pagodas. However, the first of the lot, &lt;strong&gt;Kuthodaw Pagoda&lt;/strong&gt;, seemed quite interesting. It was supposed to have the world&amp;rsquo;s largest book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg borderedimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1684/25398612153_0fdcec2542.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Startree and satellite pagodas&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Startree and satellite pagodas&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We approached Kuthodaw from the east and seeing an entrance, parked our bikes there. A man demanded 100 MMK for the bikes. Who the hell charges for bicycle parking! Anyway, we paid and went inside, leaving our footwear on the gate. We completed a circle of the pagoda. It looked beautiful. There were several tourists, a 123 year old star tree, beautiful white satellite pagodas sprawled all around the main one, but we did not find any book! I was supposing that the world&amp;rsquo;s largest book would be easy to spot. Confused, Parul asked me to check if she had not been mistaken about the name of the pagoda. Google offered a clue. Someone, in his reviews, had written that the book is set in stone. We rushed to the nearest white sub-pagoda and sure enough, instead of a Buddha image that is to be seen usually, there was a stone tablet with the book inscribed on it. We were standing &lt;strong&gt;IN&lt;/strong&gt; the world&amp;rsquo;s largest book!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg borderedimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1697/25398612523_8c0c0537bb.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;World&#39;s largest book&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;World&#39;s largest book&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Parul took photos, I went to the Western gate to collect our footwear since we would leave for the next site by foot from the southern entrance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myanmar Tip #5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever you can, carry your footwear along inside a pagoda. Though letting it be on an entrance is usually safe, you might not want to leave from the same entrance that you came in. Also, carrying a plastic bag to keep the footwear in makes it easier to handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite happy with our discovery, we left for the next site from the southern gate. Our stupidity became evident now. There were signs speaking about the inscriptions and guides explaining the stone tablets to the tourists. It was much more obvious on this side. Next, we walked to the &lt;strong&gt;Shwenandaw Kyaung&lt;/strong&gt;. This was a monastery similar to the one in Innwa. But the woodwork was much more detailed and beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg borderedimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1657/25727383520_272840b968.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Shwenandaw Monastery&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Shwenandaw Monastery&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was active restoration work underway in good taste. Inside there were carvings of Jataka stories well preserved. We saw signs that prohibited women from climbing into the main chamber in the monastery. Burmese culture was not without it&amp;rsquo;s misogyny!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Not quite egalitarian&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next and last stop for the day was &lt;strong&gt;Sandamuni Pagoda&lt;/strong&gt;, which was supposed to have the largest iron Buddha. We made a circle again but could not figure out where the largest iron Buddha was. We let it be and stopped to see the sun setting over the satellite pagodas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg borderedimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Sunset at Sandamuni&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a bunch of Europeans nearby (seemed French to me by their language) who were clicking photographs and talking aloud. A young monk passed by and I saw him do a few double takes. I thought it was because he was disdainful of one of girls wearing her slippers on the pagoda. Parul told me that it was because two of them were kissing while they got their photos clicked! Such absurd disregard for other people&amp;rsquo;s sentiments can be a result of an unparalleled cultural arrogance. I was even more sure now that they had been French.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;booking-tickets-nightlife&#34;&gt;Booking Tickets &amp;amp; Nightlife&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were considering Hsipaw or Hopin (Indawgyi Lake) for our next destination. I had inquired about the tickets on the way back to the hotel from the Mandalay Hill trip but they had told me that the tickets for Hsipaw were over and the ones to Hopin would be available the next day from 6 AM. I was sure I had read about advanced bookings of tickets but if the counter was turning me away, there was no reason to suspect otherwise. Since Hsipaw would mean wasting another day (the train to Hsipaw runs at 4 AM in the morning), we chose Hopin instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was up at 5:30 AM and was at the station counter five minutes before 6 AM. The counters were not yet open and the staff was preparing for the day&amp;rsquo;s work. People had already started waiting in lines. Not knowing which line to get in, since all the sign boards were in Burmese, I approached one of the counters and asked the gentleman inside where I could get tickets for Hopin. He stopped what he was doing and helped me very patiently, telling me the available options and the times they would reach Hopin. I chose the 10 AM option and the man pointed to another counter on the other side of the hall. The counter read &lt;a href=&#34;http://globalnewlightofmyanmar.com/myitsone-mandalar-express-down-train-launched-maiden-trip-from-myitkyina-kachin-state-on-22-december/&#34;&gt;Myitsone-Mandalar Express Train&lt;/a&gt; and was not open yet. But there was a line in front of it and I joined it. I waited till 6:15 before asking the person behind me what the opening time was. He told me 7 AM. A long line for more than an hour! I decided to go back to the hotel since it was nearby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg vertimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1544/25395474834_e84fd45feb.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Early morning queuing at ticket counter&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Early morning queuing at ticket counter&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parul and I returned around 7:30 AM to inquire at the counter. There were only ordinary class tickets left. The upper class was sold out. We asked about sleeper trains and the man told us to go back to the main counter. We went there and were told that the sleeper train would depart the next day. We chose to spend the day in Mandalay rather than take the ordinary class and spend a day recuperating in Indawgyi. We bought the tickets which were all written on a piece of paper. The man used carbon copier for records which was kind of funny to remember. The fee was 17,800 MMK per person, not exactly cheap. This was approximately INR 900 for a 500 km journey! This was way more than what the trains here should have been worth. Anyway, with our tickets booked, we quickly found another hotel to spend the night and shifted base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had another OMG meal at a Chinese place, &lt;strong&gt;The Pyay&lt;/strong&gt;. It was not your typical noodles and dumplings Chinese. This was quite different and extremely delicious as well. This was probably the most defining feature of Mandalay for me. The food was an amalgam of cultural influences from all the adjoining states. There was a bit of Shan, Kachin, Burmese, Chinese, Indian and what not to be found in the food here. You needed but to roam the streets and stop at any place (street side or otherwise) that piqued your interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Awesome Chinese lunch&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the evening we walked till the &lt;strong&gt;Jewelery Market&lt;/strong&gt;, only to find it closed. It was dark by the time we walked back and we saw the street side food joints cropping up. Some of these shops have a dish installed on a cart and a TV put up against a light pole. People huddle next to these makeshift entertainment arrangements. It is really quite amusing and ingenious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg borderedimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Roadside entertainment systems&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could see an EPL match starting as we passed some of the joints; Arsenal vs. Tottenham Hotspur. Today promised to be a lively night. Myanmar loves it&amp;rsquo;s football, especially the English Premiere League. We decided to go sit in a beer station near our new hotel. This was &lt;strong&gt;Shwe Lat Yar Beer Station&lt;/strong&gt; on the junction of 82nd and 31st streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myanmar Tip #6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mandalay and Yangon are well planned cities. Just the street number is usually enough to get you around in downtown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sat at the beer bar having some super cheap draught beer (only 700 MMK per glass), eating some starters and bitching about the pathetic level of football in the EPL. The only reason it is such a hit in the Asian markets, according to me, is because of they time it to air at our prime time. There is no other reason that someone would waste his time watching such bad football!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we were about to wrap up, a man came and pulled a chair up to our table. He introduced himself as Salman, half Indian and half Burmese. He was communicating in uncertain Hindi and managed to tell us that he owned a lungi shop in Mandalay. He also said that I looked European (well&amp;hellip;). We paid our bill, shook Salman&amp;rsquo;s hand and got up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were not done yet though. Parul wanted a picture of the lit up watchtowers of the palace reflecting in the moat. We walked all the way, happily drunk and making plans to do an MC Hammer Slide once we got there. But the trouble was that neither of us knew how to do it. No issue, YouTube to the rescue! We saw a funny video and tried out the hilarious steps once we got to the palace, laughing and wondering if the towers held snipers to shoot drunken idiots performing buffoonery in front of the palace. Parul finally got her photo as well and we returned to the hotel giggling like kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started relatively less early the next morning. The &lt;strong&gt;Stupa&lt;/strong&gt; at Sanchi would not be open before sunrise so we had decided to leave by 8 AM. I had to fix the idling RPM of my bike which had somehow reduced, so I got the bike out of the parking lot and opened it up. For some unknown reason the guys at RE had decided to make it thoroughly inconvenient to fix a thing as simple as this. BBC came back with his bike and we had a silly fight with the parking attendant over 10 rupees. It ended with us paying him an extra 10 bucks, him calling us liars and me shouting at him while he walked away. Finally I fixed the Typhon&amp;rsquo;s RPM, shut it up, withdrew some money out of an ATM, had breakfast at a street-side stall, and reached Sanchi by 9 AM. We bought a couple of tickets and a couple of delicious guavas. After eating the guavas we rode a winding road up a hill and parked our bikes in an empty parking lot. The cloak room was not open yet so we asked the guard if we could leave our bags with him. He agreed and so we dumped our bags, got our tickets stamped and went inside the &lt;strong&gt;Stupa&lt;/strong&gt; complex.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Entering the Great Stupa complex&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason the history text books had always given me the impression that the &lt;strong&gt;Stupa&lt;/strong&gt; was situated on a lowland and would be overcrowded with tourists. On the contrary, it was situated on top of a small hill which was chosen specifically for the quietude it offered that was necessary for monastic lifestyle. A bit of history :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stupa was commissioned by &lt;strong&gt;Asoka the Great&lt;/strong&gt; of the Mauryan Empire in the 3rd century BC and the construction was overlooked by his wife, Devi, who belonged to Sanchi. During the next two centuries, under the &lt;strong&gt;Shunga&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Satavahana&lt;/strong&gt; periods, the Stupa was adorned with the &lt;em&gt;toranas&lt;/em&gt; (gateways), balustrades and the canopies, as well as the Stupa 2 and 3. Many more temples and monasteries were added over the centuries as the site continued to be an active site for Buddhist activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Approaching the Great Stupa&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally found the &lt;strong&gt;Stupa&lt;/strong&gt; very exquisite. The artwork on the gateways was extremely detailed and impressive. Plus there was a detailed explanation of the artwork and the stories they represented, mostly Jataka stories. I spent quite some time looking at the artwork on all the &lt;em&gt;toranas&lt;/em&gt;. There were not many tourists around. Perhaps it was too early in the morning, or maybe it was the middle of the week. Whichever the reason, I enjoyed the peace till a loud group of Tamil aunties came, got all worked up and started conversing in loud voices. Then we moved away from the Stupa to and went on to explore the ruins of the monasteries and temples. The sun was up and the heat was slowly cranking up. We sought the shade of a large tree and sat under it hoping the attain enlightenment alike &lt;strong&gt;Buddha&lt;/strong&gt;. The conversation drifted towards &lt;em&gt;yogis&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;sanyasis&lt;/em&gt; who master their bodies to an extent of being able to defy nature. We had heard stories of people who lived in the mountains, surviving in the extreme cold without food and water. But was it a myth? Did such people really exist? If so, where could one find them? We contemplated the questions for a while and then gave up the futile exercise to go explore more temples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After having seen most of the &lt;em&gt;vihara&lt;/em&gt;, we decided to get a cup of coffee and then leave our own separate ways. The &lt;strong&gt;Stupa&lt;/strong&gt; more or less marked the end of our trip. From here, BBC would go back to Vidisha, thence to Jhansi and home to Agra. I would continue towards Pune, covering as much distance as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this definitely was not the end of my adventure. The few kilometers till Bhopal went by easily enough. The day was still young and not many vehicles had taken to the road. From Bhopal onwards, the highway got much better. It became a one way, 4 or 6 lane highway and allowed me a decent amount of speed. I was planning to reach Dhule by the end of the day. This would make my next day easier, leaving just a few hours of travel to Pune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1525/24562380953_963dc801a7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;mp-roads-6&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;One-way highway to Indore&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the change of highway quality and was making quite good time. Around forty kilometers out of Bhopal, I crossed the village of Dodi and decided to stop under a tree to rehydrate and take a short break. Once I was ready to leave, I found that my bike was unwilling to comply. It was the &lt;strong&gt;EFI&lt;/strong&gt; (Electronic Fuel Injector) again! I tried all the tricks I had learnt in the previous months, hoping that it would be one of the older problems that had resurfaced. But nothing worked. The battery was okay, the handle twisting did not activate the EFI, the wires seemed fine. I was at the end of options, so I tried calling the phone numbers of the workshops in Indore that were listed online. None of them picked up. I did the only logical thing I could, I dragged the bike a kilometer back to Dodi and asked for a mechanic. I was not expecting to find a RE workshop here but something would be better than nothing. The mechanic was one of the rare type that actually listen to the customer rather than acting like a know-it-all that most of the RE mechanics are in a habit to do. We started looking for the fault and failing to find it, decided to check the EFI. He pulled a wire directly from the EFI to the battery and it buzzed alive. So the EFI was not faulty. Phew! That was good news. Since the mechanic did not have time on his hands, he suggested that he could make a direct connection for the EFI and I could get the wiring checked in Indore. Though I would have liked to get the wiring check then and there, he said he would not be available for another couple of hours at least and assured me that I would be good for the distance till Indore. While I contemplated and he taped up the wires that he had opened to inspect, I asked him if there could be a fault with the engine switch on the handle bar. I switch it off and on nonchalantly and lo and behold! The EFI had started working without a direct connection! I swear I will never understand Typhon! At times he just seems like a moody woman that I am stuck with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to simply accept that something had worked and not shake things up any further. I learnt how to make a direct connection just in case I needed to do it further down the road. Then we closed everything the way it was and I resumed down the highway towards Indore. I had lost just an hour in this ordeal and could still make it to Dhule by the end of the day. Perhaps I would have to drive an hour or so in the dark but it would be worth the effort the following day. I stopped on the Indore bypass for some lunch. It was a proper restaurant instead of a highway &lt;em&gt;dhaba&lt;/em&gt; but I thought I would allow myself this luxury. The decision was regrettable. The waiter brought a chicken &lt;em&gt;biryani&lt;/em&gt; instead of the mutton &lt;em&gt;biryani&lt;/em&gt; that I had ordered. On top of it he decided to argue that he remembered what I had ordered while I did not. Then the owner decided to charge me more than the price given in the menu. When I asked him what that was all about, he told me that the prices had increased and the menus had not been updated. I was quite frustrated and decided that the twenty rupees was definitely not worth the time. So I paid and got out of the restaurant fuming and furious at being cheated; the value being of no relevance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was three in the afternoon and the sun was glaring down on the earth. The heat was getting to my head and I was feeling a little uncomfortable. I broke up the remaining kilometers in chunks and milestones. I took a break at every milestone and refreshed myself with a tea in case a stall was available, or with some water and shade. One of the tea stalls had a rather curious owner. He told me that I reminded him of a biker friend of his who was in the army and was currently posted in Goa. Elsewhere I rested my tired back in solitude. The sun went down slowly and the heat lessened. I crossed the border to Maharashtra while the sun was low in the western sky. Dhule was not much farther away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1630/24893593700_7ce02abc96.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;maharashtra-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Entering Maharastra to good highways&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was close to Dhule when it got dark enough for the headlights to be switched on. In another hour, I was at my destination and stopped by the streetside to check if there were accommodation options listed online. A bike stopped next to me and asked me where I was coming from. Thus began another conversation with two young men who were curious about who I was and where I was coming from. They were even curious about the price of the bike and then the salary I was earning. I gave them satisfactory answers and some dampened figures. In return I took a recommendation for lodgings. The recommended lodging was a bit too expensive for a water hole. So I decided to go further inside the city. An &lt;em&gt;auto-walah&lt;/em&gt; gave me another recommendation and I followed it. This one was within my budget and I checked myself into &lt;strong&gt;Lodge Comfort Inn&lt;/strong&gt;. While I was entering my details in the register, two more Marathi men asked me about my trip thus far and my plans further. They were a bit more thorough and asked for more details. I gladly answered them, the conversation was nothing I was averse to. Then I went up to the room and got out of my riding gear. I rested a while and then went back down to grab a bite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had some disappointing bhel and then went to a dining hall that the owner of the guest house had recommended. This place had a long waiting line, and I had to wait for almost twenty minutes! Usually I do not wait this long for food but I was quite curious as to why people were thronging this particular dining hall in a big city like Dhule. While I waited, I noticed that Dhule had a lot of Hindi speaking population. I guessed it was because of it&amp;rsquo;s proximity to the state border. When my turn did come, I went and sat and was served with an unlimited meal. It totally justified the price, though not the wait. No food is worth such a long wait, in my opinion. Never the less, the simple meal was quite delicious and I ended up overeating! But I still bought a bowl of &lt;em&gt;srikhand&lt;/em&gt; at the end and lapped that up as well. I suffered from the pleasurable discomfort of an overstuffed stomach as I walked back to my guest house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1604/24821534489_3f13a2fa81.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;dhule-chetna-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;A primer to the tasty vegetarian thali&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once back, I tried sleeping and managed to in a short while. The day had been long and tiring and the trip meter had read 1668 when I parked the bike. The blanket given seemed unwashed since ages and I decided not to use it. But the mosquitoes forced me to cover myself up with it despite my hesitation. I have little recollection from the remainder of the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;dhule-to-pune-shirdi-madness&#34;&gt;Dhule to Pune, Shirdi Madness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up the next morning and was glad not to have contracted any skin ailments. I quickly changed and checked out. I left the main highway (NH3) and took the detour to Shirdi. The main highway was going to continue to Nashik and thence to Mumbai. I stopped here for some breakfast. Good old poha and masala dosa! Then I resumed the journey on the two way highway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1459/25070974822_1ac5e17631.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;maharashtra-3&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;NH3 out of Dhule&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highway was quite well made and the traffic was easy. However, as I neared Shirdi, I could see a lot of people walking on my side of the road. Initially it did not strike me but these people were walking a length of more than 5 kilometers, making a pilgrimage to the Sai Baba temple! They had choked the street to a near halt and support vehicles slowly moved with them, taking up another lane of the road, blaring loud music and distributing packets of water to the devotees. The used up packets were thrown on the roads and made for an impressive sight. Things people do in the name of devotion. I somehow managed to cross the few kilometers till Shirdi town. Here people started popping out and coming uncomfortably close to my bike, offering parking spots and hotel rooms. Hoarding announced budget lodgings and various kinds of food preparations. I have developed a strong disgust for such commercialised religions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Shirdi, I took a couple of more stops and was in Pune before two in the afternoon. It had been a short day and I was left with enough time to rest my tired body. The trip meter gave me a total of 2021 kilometers since Delhi. The distance felt like an accomplishment of sorts. I celebrated the rest of the day doing nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would spend the coming week repairing Typhon, taking care of some professional commitments and wondering if I had rushed the road trip too much. Madhya Pradesh had been amazing. It was probably one of the more underrated states. There are a lot of historical gems there but they are unfortunately not widely promoted. It would take some time to explore the place. And for the lack of any state transport, it can be best explored by the road on a vehicle of your own. Of course the traffic is a little crazy and you risk the buses and trucks running you off the road, but hey! That&amp;rsquo;s part of the adventure, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do recommend a bike trip, if you have the time and appetite for it. Riding is an experience of it&amp;rsquo;s own. I have not yet come up with a convincing argument of my own as to why one should ride. So, for the time being, I will redirect you to a post that my friend wrote about our &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.devashish.me/2016/01/04/riding-across-the-thar/&#34;&gt;road trip through the Great Indian Thar desert&lt;/a&gt;. The opening paragraphs list some compelling reasons of why one would, in his sane mind, choose to ride on two wheels rather than four.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>

&lt;p&gt;I had visited Hampi last in the October of 2014. It is a quiet village in the heart of Karnataka, close to Hosapete and Ballari. I had really liked the place back then; something about the laid back idleness of the place giving me a much needed break from my hectic schedule and the lack of mobile network only adding to the peace. Three days had gone by in a jiffy and there was a feeling of incompletion when I boarded the bus back to Pune. So when the opportunity presented itself for a return to this charming town, I had no reason to turn it down. The excuse : a half marathon being organised by a group that called itself &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.goheritagerun.com/&#34;&gt;Go Heritage Run&lt;/a&gt;. I signed up for the run and made the necessary travel arrangements. Parul was coming with a group of her friends from Pune. We were going to make a vacation of this long weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-to-hampi&#34;&gt;Getting To Hampi&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hampi is a quaint little town that does not have much more than history to boast of. The rustic neighborhood is accessible via road. Perhaps the easiest way to get there (unless you are driving down directly) is to get to Hosapete and then catch a local bus to Hampi. Hosapete is quite well connected by rail and road. Majority of the bus services operating in Karnataka have Hosapete on their map. Or you could catch a train to the Hosapete station. The latter being by preferred mode of travel, I looked up the available options and found a seat in the slow passenger train from Bangalore to Hosapete. Since I was in no rush to get to the town, the passenger train worked out pretty well. It would get me to Hosapete around mid noon and it would take me another hour or so to get to Hampi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had spent a rather hectic week in Bangalore, rushing around to meet friends, catch up on pending correspondence, working on a couple of projects, etc. I was looking forward to some time out without any agenda on my mind. There was more hectic travelling and running around that would ensue immediately afterwards, so there was all the more reason to savour this time the best I could. I boarded the train at Bangalore Central railway station. The coaches of the train seemed to be arranged at random which made finding my coach a little painful. I eventually did find the coach and dumped my luggage. The train started shortly after and I retired to my berth. I prefer the upper berth; it is like a private nook of your own in a chaotic train cabin. The simple sleeper compartment can get specially noisy and stuffed but there is some inkling of privacy in the upper berth. This one, however, was not too clean. Someone had thought it a good idea to climb up with his muddy shoes! I somehow arranged my backpack to cover the muddy part and lied down without thinking too much of the dirt. It was nothing that a bath could not cleanse me of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a tough time falling asleep because of my throat infection. It had been troubling me intermittently for quite some time now and medications barely help me. I slept a restless sleep, waking up from time to time to adjust myself. During one of these bouts of consciousness I realised that the night was over, people had started waking up and moving about. Faint morning light was struggling to light up the compartment but the upper berth was the secure in the safety of it&amp;rsquo;s remoteness. I eventually woke up when Parul called to tell me that they had reached Hosapete and were going to Hampi. The clock said 9:30 AM and my train was supposed to reach in another couple of hours. I stretched and made my way down. The train had been standing still for a while now. I went out to check what the matter was. Instead of the 10+ bogies that had crossed last night to find mine, only 5 stood on the platform with no engine on either end. The random arrangement of the compartments made sense now. The train had split up at Ballari and while most of it travelled on to Hubbali, a few compartments were left behind to be towed by a diesel engine till Hosapete. After a fairly lengthy break, an engine attached itself to one end of the abandoned bogies and we resumed our journey. The weather was rather pleasant and I enjoyed the wind and views that the journey had to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;http://grasskode.xyz/images/hampi/train1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Train Journey&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Onwards to Hosapete&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Track Gazing&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The train got us to Hosapete a few minutes earlier than the appointed hour. I turned down the auto-rickshaws that offered to take me to the bus-stop or Hampi and walked the couple of kilometers to the bus stand. After a small and quick meal of keema and parotas, I boarded a bus to Hampi. Currently route numbers &lt;strong&gt;301&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;302&lt;/strong&gt; ply between Hosapete and Hampi. This bus was quite crowded with the local students who came from the surrounding villages to study in the schools and colleges of Hosapete. I spent a few minutes studying the hands of a young woman who was crammed up next to my seat and had to hold the window railing right in front of me for support. There were three dots of ink on the back of her hand at the base of the thumb; perhaps a mark that had been given to her as a child. The boundaries had blurred over the years and now lacked in sharpness of a fresh tattoo. I had not seen the woman but her hand indicated that she was quite young. The skin lacked the creases of age. Dirt trapped near the tips of the fingers suggested that the hand was subjected to outdoor work. I fell asleep contemplating the kind of life that she must have led. Within a few minutes of leaving Hosapete the crowd started easening and I woke up to find that the hand had left my presence sometime during the journey. We reached Hampi soon after and I picked up my luggage and deboarded the bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.goheritagerun.com/&#34;&gt;Go Heritage Run&lt;/a&gt; management had set up the bib collection at the end of the Hampi Market. I walked up to them and gathered my bib. No RFID implying no timing of the run. I liked the idea. I immediately walked back to the river jetty and took a boat to the north of the river. The Tungabhadra was flowing at a serene pace and a usual crowd had gathered on the banks to bathe in it&amp;rsquo;s waters. I got off on the other side and walked along the main road towards the guest house. The north of the river is something of a small hippie village with a profusion of foreigners, mostly Israelis. The place had gotten more crowded and new cafes and lodgings had cropped up in the year and a half that I had last seen it. Numerous shop owners offered bikes and scooters for rent as I made my way to the guest house. I found Parul and Aamir relaxing in hammocks, the rest were on their way. I took a quick bath, freshened up and lay in a hammock as the remainder of the party streamed in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once everyone had taken a breather, we decided to hike till the sunset point. There was a small temple up on one of the rocks nearby and we had seen a beautiful sunset from there the last time. En route, however, an enterprising young man, who went by the name of Venkatesh, sold us a few cups of tea at bloated prices and told us about another sunset point that was much more popular and where people apparently jammed. Sounded interesting and since everyone was up for it, we set out following young Venky to the other point. Turned out that it was at the other end of the village and included a decent amount of climb. We found a good spot that offered an exquisite view of the Virupaksha Temple and Matanga hills on the other side of the river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The green paddy fields down below reflected the sky beautifully. The sun stay hidden behind the clouds for quite a while and was mellow by the time it reappeared in the sky. We spent a good couple of hours there, enjoying the view and indulging in activities of personal taste - photography, music, reading, etc. Towards the sunset the crowd thickened and the place lost it&amp;rsquo;s serenity. We left shortly after the sun had set. There was still a little brightness to be availed for the climb down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent the rest of the evening eating some unexceptional food in &lt;em&gt;Top Secret River View Cafe&lt;/em&gt; and listening to some good music. With a tiring day behind us and another one up ahead, I decided to retire early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;running-around-hampi&#34;&gt;Running around Hampi&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alarm woke me up at 5:45 AM. I quickly washed up and went to check on the others. By 6:15 AM five of us - Trupti, Parul, Aamir, Bhargava and I, were making their way to the river side to catch a boat to the other side. My run began in 30 minutes. The boats had not yet started plying and a lone coracle was making it&amp;rsquo;s rounds in the dark waters of the Tungabhadra. The asking price was an exorbitant INR 100 per person but we realised that we did not have an option at the moment. So we allowed ourselves the extortion and found ourselves on the other side of the river with five minutes to spare for the run. Fortunately the run was delayed by a few minutes and I made it to the start point right in time for the flag off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The air was cool and pleasant and the sun had not yet made itself visible when we started running out of Hampi. The path curled into an intimidating incline immediately outside Hampi market but gradually planed out. The police were helping out with the arrangement and the run seemed to be well managed. There were not many participants in the 21K category that I had signed up for and I, for one, enjoyed running without the crowd that usually throngs such events. We ran on the tarred road, passing ruins on either sides. A pleasant orange sun rose in the eastern sky while we passed through the verdant surroundings. The traffic was easy and, but for an occasional rowdy truck driver, the route seemed quite safe. The track was an out and back one and we took a U-turn near Vitthala Temple. Here we ran into quite a few 5K runners who had taken a different (shorter) route. Aamir and Bhargava were running this category but I could not spot them. I took my first break right after the U-turn and hydrated myself. I was doing better than I had expected of myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;http://grasskode.xyz/images/hampi/vitthala.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Stone Chariot at Vitthala Temple&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here on I encountered a lot of runners coming from the opposite direction. These were the ones of the 12K category. A few 21K runners overtook me but I did not feel the inclination to compete with them. I was not competing for position. I usually ran with a target time as personal goal but this time around I was not too keen on the time as well. I was doing this to check my fitness level and to renew the determination that a half marathon requires. I had been out of practice for quite a while and knew that my physical form was lacking. I was just looking to complete the run in the vicinity of 2 hours. I have always believed that timing depends on one&amp;rsquo;s physical form whereas completion is more about the mental form. The route back was a bit more taxing. I kept my pace and stopped when I felt too tired. The weather was quite helpful and so was the scenic route. A langur looked on from the roadside, surprised at so many humans running with nothing to chase! I eventually crossed the finish line and a rough calculation told me that the time had been around 1:55. Not bad; not bad at all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aamir and Bhargava had completed their run a little while back and Adityo had joined the group in the two hours I had been running. We met Chris who had participated in the 21K as well. We chatted for a while, cooled down and had some of the breakfast that the management had arranged. Then we headed back to the guest house to take a bath and stretch our limbs. Back in the guest house I took a bath and went and relaxed in the cafe. The service was slow but none of us were in a rush. Chris came around and told us about the bicycle trip that he had done the previous day around Hampi. Seemed like a good idea but it was not a possibility on that day. My legs were not up to the task. After lunch everyone went their own ways. Some went exploring the ruins of Hampi, some lounged around in the cafe, I went back to the room for a nap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parul woke us up around 4:30 PM. We hired scooters and went to the Sanapur Lake. This lake is another charming aspect of the north side of the river. You can spend hours there swimming in the cool waters, lying on rocks and looking at the sun travel across the sky or taking a coracle ride in the lake. To our surprise, the lake had very little water this time. Parul was astounded since she had come here a mere two months back and found the lake full to the hilt. The water level had gone down by more than a few meters! Which meant that our usual spot which offered a great swimming space was out of question. In fact swimming did not seem like an option at all. We searched for and found a spot a little ahead of the usual one. This area would have been completely submerged with the usual level of water. Cameras and GoPros came out and were set up for hyper-lapse photography. The sun was already behind the boulders on the far side of the lake and the sky bore a reddish tint. We sat for a while, talking and listening to music. Some climbed up rocks and played pirates. Minutes flew by and it was dark by the time we started wrapping up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;http://grasskode.xyz/images/hampi/lake.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Sunset at the Sanapur Lake&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aamir said that this was a perfect setting for a horror movie. Ten people lost in the woods in the dark and then people suddenly start disappearing. Though none of us disappeared, the darkness was not really helpful. I could no longer see the lake and was guiding the party out with a certain amount of uncertainity. The moon was not yet up and the darkness was near complete. Our feeble torches did little to help, but we did manage to find our way out successfully! Though some complained of hearing sounds in the bushes, everyone was out without incident. Encouraged, we decided to continue the adventure and take the long route back. A near-full moon had risen in the sky as we slowly made our way through the villages and fields. But for a single wrong turn, which was immediately corrected by the villagers, we did alright this time. The roads were unlit and uncrowded, the air cool again; we rode in silence with the only sound being the hum of our engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended the day with some good Indian food at a cafe right next to our guest house. This place (Rasta Cafe) was not too crowded and the service and food were pretty good. Back in the guest house, we retired early once again to recover from the taxing day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-day-in-ruins&#34;&gt;A Day in Ruins&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We woke up without much of an agenda the next day. A few had woke up early to go watch the sunrise from the Hanunman Temple but Aamir, Parul and I had opted out of the plan. We slept till 10 and then got up and made plans for the day while having breakfast at Rasta Cafe. The three of us agreed on renting out bicycles on the other side of the river and exploring the ruins around town. After breakfast we caught up with the others and started off with them. Bhargava was also interested in renting the bicycle while the others were of the opinion to spend their time in a less hectic manner. We crossed the river on the boats and while we waited for the others, I got the (now familiar) &lt;em&gt;firang&lt;/em&gt; treatment. A couple of guys asked me my name and pronounced it with an anglicized accent (something like &lt;em&gt;Karen&lt;/em&gt;). It was probably my attire : a white kurta on top of knee length shorts, but I have gotten mistaken for a foreigner from time to time. It is a rather amusing study in our well known xenophilia. People walked up to me and offered me some rice puffs! They would never have been so gracious had they seen me for the Indian that I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once everyone had managed to cross to the south of the river, we split up. The bicycles were short in supply and exorbitantly expensive! I haggled to a lower price but it was still too costly. Anyhow, we got four geared cycles and set out to explore. The climb right outside Hampi market got everyone. Most of us were new to geared cycles and unable to use it properly and efficiently. The weather was hotter than the previous days and the sky was clear. The glaring sun did not help our situation any but we kept at it and the road gradually got smoother. We rode at an easy pace and the traffic was not a problem. Within a few minutes we reached the ruins complex that we had set out to see. While we were locking up or cycles, the others made an appearance in an auto-rickshaw! So much for separate ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first stop was an underground Shiva temple. It was underground in the sense that the temple&amp;rsquo;s top was at the current ground level. The temple was not an active one; very plainly built, without much adornments on the walls. After the outer chamber, the base was covered in a layer of water a couple of inches deep. The water seemed stale and a strong smell of bat droppings invaded our nostrils. The inner chamber had a very &lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones-ey&lt;/em&gt; feel to it. Bats fluttered around and light was scant. On the other end of the inner chamber was yet another chamber. This was the main chamber with a &lt;em&gt;shiva linga&lt;/em&gt; inside that was visible only if the entrance to the inner chamber was unobstructed! I have seen such use of natural light before and am totally in awe of such architectural styles. All of us roamed about for a while and then left the temple. A glass of lemon soda to refresh ourselves and onwards to the next site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next site was a open area that used to be the Mohammadean residence. We could go inside with our bikes and so we did. There was a watch tower up ahead and we rode up to it. Riding on tracks is so much fun! As expected, the watch tower was closed. Indians have a tendency to lock up places and restrict movement. Anyway, we rested a while, listened to some music and then left for the next place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hazararama temple was quite a delight. In a grand style that is typical to Vaishnavite temples, it was well sculpted and adorned with impressive artwork. The walls of the temple told the story of the Ramayana in short. I tried to follow some of the murals that I could make sense of. Perhaps the name of the temple was derived from the numerous Rama images that were present on the temple walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Murals depicting Ramayana&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left for the Zanana Enclosure next. This was a well maintained compound to the north of the Hazararama temple. There was a ticket for this complex with the standard rates of INR 10 for Indian citizens and INR 250 for foreign nationals. We talked about the disparity of the rates but it seemed fair that the beauties of the land be accessible to all it&amp;rsquo;s citizens and offered to outsiders at a price. The Zanana Enclosure contained the famed Lotus Mahal and the Elephant Stables. The stables were grand and imposing, befitting the beast it must have harboured in the times of yore. The Lotus Mahal seemed an exaggeration; it was neither much of a mahal nor resembled a lotus very blatantly. Perhaps the petal arches of the gateways were what gave the structure it&amp;rsquo;s name; or maybe the curling extension of the roof that lent the structure a somewhat floral touch. I could not find any text explaining the significance of the Mahal so I can guess at best. Apart from these, the complex contained a temple that we skipped, the basement of the queen&amp;rsquo;s palace that was quite ordinary, a museum that contained quite a few intriguing relics and a couple of watchtowers that were quite quite beautiful and seemed right out of a video game (Age of Empires) I used to play!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Watchtowers in Zanana Enclosure&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were running short of time to explore the final area that lay to our south. This was the Royal Enclosure and had seemed quite crowded. We decided to skip it and go to Kamlapur instead. We needed to withdraw some money for our expenses, there being no ATM in Hampi. Kamlapur was less than a kilometer away and we quickly finished our business and headed back to Hampi. The undulating roads seemed less tiring this time around but we were still exhausted by the time we returned to Hampi Bazar. We returned the bicycles and decided to grab something to eat before catching a ferry to the north side. Bhargava and I munched on some gobi manchurian (a South Indian delicacy :P) and a plate of masala rice. Then we joined Parul and Aamir in &lt;em&gt;The Mango Tree Restaurant&lt;/em&gt; for some &lt;em&gt;lassis&lt;/em&gt;. Our stomachs at ease, we set out to cross the river with the last minute traffic. The sun was mellowing down and would soon disappear from the sky, leaving an orange afterglow, which in turn would give way to the night&amp;rsquo;s darkness. After lot of pushing and shoving we managed to get to the other side and returned to the guest house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;au-revoir-hampi&#34;&gt;Au Revoir, Hampi&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning was mostly spent packing up and seeing the folks off. Bhargava was riding back on his KTM Duke. Adityo was driving Trupti, Kapil and Priyanka back to Pune. We were delayed somewhat by the utterly unprofessional behaviour of the guest house manager. Parul had made reservations beforehand and a mail chain had recorded the confirmation of five rooms at a fixed rate. The manager blatantly refused the arrangement, saying that he had never agreed to the rate and that his rate was more than what was mentioned in the mail, which, as per him, he had specified in a phone call. We tried to make him understand that it was utterly unprofessional to simply raise the rate for a prior reservation at whim, but when he said something to the effect of &amp;ldquo;You pay me what I want&amp;rdquo;, I knew it was a lost cause. We paid him, put up a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g319725-d2458962-r342724341-Gouthami_Guest_House_Vista_Rooms-Hampi_Karnataka.html&#34;&gt;review on Tripadvisor&lt;/a&gt; and left with a sour taste in our mouth. Unfortunately his business will continue to flourish despite what we had experienced. We go where the rates are cheap. Who cares about unprofessional conduct by a manager?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We killed some hours in Rasta again. Yes, we were definitely in love with it. We lazed around and watched a movie. I worked on my writing. We even played a game of pictionary!
&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;http://grasskode.xyz/images/hampi/rasta.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Rasta Cafe&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Rasta Cafe&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
By 3 PM we had decided that enough time had been killed. We paid our bills and walked down to the river jetty to cross to the other side. Then we had a lunch at &lt;em&gt;The Mango Tree Restaurant&lt;/em&gt;. The food here was quite good, though a little expensive. After lunch we caught a bus back to Hosapete which got us to the town uneventfully. Then we saw KK and Ruta off before catching up with Chris in front of our bus stand. We spent the remainder of the hour at a juice shop, chatting in general and drinking fresh fruit juice. Our bus made an appearance and we boarded. We were off to Pune with all it&amp;rsquo;s city bustle. So long, Hampi&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
