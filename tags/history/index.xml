          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77103.The_Glass_Palace&#34; style=&#34;float: left; padding-right: 20px&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;The Glass Palace&#34; src=&#34;https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1388345246m/77103.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77103.The_Glass_Palace&#34;&gt;The Glass Palace&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3369.Amitav_Ghosh&#34;&gt;Amitav Ghosh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My rating: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1594044070&#34;&gt;2 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I had sworn off Ghosh for good. But an uncle (the same one who had lent me his copy of &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/215678.In_an_Antique_Land&#34;&gt;In An Antique Land&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;) told me to pick this book since I was about to go to Burma. With a rather divided mind I eventually got a kindle version of this book and started reading it a few days prior to my departure to the &amp;ldquo;Land of Gold&amp;rdquo;. The reading continued well into the trip and I finally finished during a train journey to the northern state of Kachin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is definitely one of Ghosh&amp;rsquo;s better works. It tells the rags-to-riches-and-back story of a certain Indian boy who made it big in Burma. It was partially in line with Haley&amp;rsquo;s Roots. The exile of the last king and queen of Burma was worked in quite well. The trouble : there was a lack of something pivotal in the story. The protagonist lost center stage at times and while other characters tried gaining focus, they were pushed back into obscurity before they could make their presence felt. It seemed a rather hastened narration of fictionalized history. All this rendered the book rather dry and, had the purpose been so, didactic. Ghosh could have done much better with this story. His research is very evident and the way he has managed to make a story of all the historical events is also very impressive. If only the story-telling had been up to the mark, this book would have been a delight. For me, however, the history of Queen Supayalat and King Thibaw and their palace in Mandalay was a delightful knowledge when I actually saw their effigies in the Mandalay Palace. In a certain way I could relate to the palace through Ghosh&amp;rsquo;s words, for which I shall ever remain thankful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rajkumar Raha, the protagonist of the story, is a young boy who finds himself in Mandalay when the English defeat the Burmese kingdom and make it a part of the Empire. While the king and queen are being exiled, he sees a strikingly beautiful girl, Dolly, in the queen&amp;rsquo;s entourage and falls in love with her. Years later Rajkumar is wiser and has made a fortune for himself in the Burmese wood industry. He seeks out Dolly in Ratnagiri, asks for her hand in marriage and takes her back to Yangon. The story follows their lives and the lives of the next two generations of their family and the ones closely associated with theirs. In the background take place the Great War and the age of rubber plantations, World War II, Japanese invasion of Malaya and Burma, the struggle for independence of India and Burma, and even the modern usurping of power by the military junta and the struggle for democracy by Aung San Suu Kyi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am not sure whether I enjoyed this book or not. Apart from it&amp;rsquo;s dryness I cannot really find any fault in this one (as opposed to &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://bookedvorm.blogspot.in/2010/10/calcutta-chromosome-amitav-ghosh.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&gt;The Calcutta Chromosome&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;). Ghosh&amp;rsquo;s forte remains his research. I still find his storytelling not compatible with my palate. Unless there is another strong recommendation, I would not bother picking up Ghosh&amp;rsquo;s work proactively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/20996466-karan-gupta&#34;&gt;View all my reviews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Mandalay - Three Weeks in Burma</title>
          <link>http://grasskode.xyz/post/travel/myanmar-mandalay/</link>

          <description>

&lt;p&gt;Parul and I decided to visit Burma / Myanmar for a vacation in late February 2016. We ended up getting three full weeks to travel the beautiful country. In a country like Myanmar that has a rapidly evolving tourism industry, I intend to fill the gaps that I found while trying to plan a trip myself. That and a first hand narrative of the wonderful experiences that we have had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is for the second leg of travel - Mandalay (2 Mar 2016 - 5 Mar 2016).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;irrawaddy-river-cruise&#34;&gt;Irrawaddy River Cruise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We checked out really early the next morning and the cab was waiting for us by the time we got downstairs. It was a rather short ride to the jetty and hardly worth the money that we paid for. Could have easily walked the distance in 30 minutes or so. There were two boats docked at the jetty. A man checked our tickets and pointed to the smaller of the two. The few passengers we could see were on the bigger one. Parul was apprehensive that she would be able to cross the wooden plank to the boat without falling while I was dreading that the boat ride would be a repetition of our &lt;em&gt;shared&lt;/em&gt; cab to Mount Popa. Both of us were in the wrong though. Parul made it to the boat without incident and we knew that we had more travellers on the boat when we dumped our luggage on a pile of bags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were not many though. Apart from the two of us there was a group of three Dutch travellers, one man and two women. We were joined by another female before the boat departed. All the travellers other than us were a little advanced in years. I would have put them in their early sixties. Myanmar seemed to be a place where you could see a considerable percentage of older travellers. I think it was because of the romance of the place that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wolverton-mountain.com/articles/on_the_road_to_mandalay.html&#34;&gt;Kipling&amp;rsquo;s poem&lt;/a&gt; had created in that generation. Or maybe it was because what the country had to offer. The neighbouring countries held more charm for the younger population, though we did find a lot of them as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the boats started off in quick succession, the other boat (MGRG) a couple of minutes before ours (Malikha). There seemed to be more people on board the MGRG boat. Once again, it was a difference that online presence had made. Malikha was comfortable enough; had a nice deck, reasonable food options, clean toilet, enough seats to sit or sleep in. Though I suppose MGRG had more amenities, there was a considerable price difference as well. Malikha had cost us 30 USD while MGRG was more than 40.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg borderedimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1484/25906933962_702d7bf143.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Early morning departure&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Early morning departure&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An orange glow on the eastern sky announced the spot that the sun would come up. The sceneries were quite amazing. The sky was somewhat cloudy but it did not blotch the beauty of the sunrise. Since Parul was taking pictures, I realised that this was one of those rare occasions when I could actually enjoy living the moment rather than spending time capturing it. It has become a compulsive habit that I am not too fond of. The story that plays in my mind demands pictures, and so, as if by reflex, I pull out my phone and start clicking. I sat down and enjoyed the wind. We were cruising comfortably at about 15 kmph. The river&amp;rsquo;s dark waters brightened. It was a calm and steady surface broken only in the wake of the two boats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg borderedimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1556/25906932632_eaf328c3f2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Rising Sun&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Sun rising over the Irrawaddy&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moon had not yet vanished from the sky when the orange glow turned to a shade of red and there appeared a circular embodiment of the light. Small birds, the species of which I am unaware of, were flying along the surface of the river, possibly looking for a morning snack. Fishing boats had started plying over the Irrawaddy. The river had come alive! Both of us thought that this one was better than the one we had seen a couple of days ago from the crowded Bulethi Pagoda in Bagan. If not for the continuous hum of the boat&amp;rsquo;s engine, it might even have been one of the best settings that I have been a part of in my life!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fell asleep on the deck and had a comfortable three hour sleep. The cold wind and warm sun were striking a perfect balance. Eventually the sun grew hotter and I moved indoors to less lazy activities like reading and writing. The Innwa bridge came into sight around 3:30 PM announcing Mandalay&amp;rsquo;s approach. The pagodas of Sagaing came into view and within another hour our boat had reached the jetty and we were picking our luggage and thanking the staff before deboarding the boat. The old folk took a taxi while we decided to walk the four odd kilometers to the Hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1600/25398218673_45565ddc85.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Innwa Bridge&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Innwa Bridge and the pagodas of Sagaing&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That night we started exploring the amazing food scene in Mandalay. We went to a famous Shan food place a little far away, Golden Shan. It was supposed to be a typical Shan buffet but by 9:30 PM some of the dishes were already gone. The food was pretty good though. We had seen a &amp;ldquo;Dagon Beer Station&amp;rdquo; on the way and thought we would hang around a bit before heading back to the hotel. But by the time we were returning, even that had shut down! Mandalay slept early as well. We were expecting different from the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ancient-capital-region&#34;&gt;Ancient Capital Region&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a decent hotel in Mandalay. It was a tad bit expensive but that was to be expected of a city. Weirdly, we could not find any listings of hostels in Mandalay. The one that was listed was offering extremely expensive dorm beds. Perhaps the hostel culture has not yet invaded the country despite the tourism boom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had decided to cover the more distant parts of Mandalay on the first day. These were places of historical significance like &lt;strong&gt;Mingun, Sagaing and Amarapura&lt;/strong&gt;. They were spread out across the two banks of the Irrawaddy. We were on the eastern side of the river. Mingun and Sagaing happen to be bang on the opposite side. There are a couple of daily ferries that ply between Mandalay and Mingun, allowing tourists a decent enough time to explore the ruins of the old town and then return to Mandalay. But we decided to rent out a bike instead and explore on our own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bike that the hotel arranged for us was something of a novelty for me. It was a clutch-less geared system. It took me a while to figure out how it worked. And all the time I had a feeling that I was doing something horribly wrong; that I was mistreating the engine by changing gears without a clutch. But this was the vehicle of choice in the city and everyone was riding it in a similar manner. Almost immediately after leaving our hotel, the bike stuttered to a stop and refused to start. While I frantically tried the ignition and the kick start, a man walked up to me to indicate that the bike was out of fuel. Great! Mandalay&amp;rsquo;s road side fuel sales came to the rescue and we were finally off to Mingun. We refueled once more at an actual petrol pump on the way to find out that the price difference between road side and pump fuel was almost 80%! Or maybe it was just standard tourist price that we had paid for the bottle of petrol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;mingun&#34;&gt;Mingun&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mingun is to the west of the Irrawaddy and to get there from Mandalay you need to go south, cross the Mandalay bridge to Sagaing and then head north along the river to Mingun. The road till Sagaing was a nice and broad one with heavy traffic and toll collections. It was nothing exceptional in any way. But once we took the river side road from Sagaing, things got interesting. Past the town, the road winded through small hamlets scattered on the roadside. Untamed countryside went past us with its hues of brown and green. There was little greenery this time of the year since it was the dry season. The rural landscapes were quite similar to what we are accustomed to back in India. The only difference being the numbers. I think that is, in essence, what differentiates Myanmar from India. This country seemed a less crowded version of our own. The roads and landscapes were similar; the daily engagements of people were familiar; the food was awesome; the people were friendly, easily intrigued by foreigners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the villages that we passed had a rather elaborate &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinbyu&#34;&gt;Shinbyu ceremony&lt;/a&gt; going on. We stopped our bike and walked up to the crowd of people clogging the narrow street. There were pick up trucks lined on one side, to be stuffed with the crowd that was celebrating on the street. The boys who were to be initiated into monkhood sat decorated on plastic chairs with a nonchalant attitude to the hullabaloo around them. The families celebrated with zest! A dancing troupe with tribal getup was dancing to English numbers from 2010; Pitbull, Jeniffer Lopez and Shakira.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg borderedimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1575/25907236292_ffdfea7670.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Shaking a leg to Pitbull&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Shaking a leg to Pitbull&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the striking mismatch between the sound and the getup, they seemed to be all well coordinated and danced rather well. The villagers stood around, some watching in amusement while a few inebriated men danced along in less coordinated steps. Their wives ran around collecting them when they got too close to interrupting the professionals and they simply continued dancing wherever they were left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg vertimg borderedimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1540/25933244251_d1ac563a42.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Skit at Shinbyu&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Villagers enjoying a musical skit&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the tribal dance, we were treated to a musical skit. It seemed to be about the tussle between a man and a woman, seemingly lovers. In the typical fashion of rural sense of amusement, it got a little lewd but entertaining nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/140507143@N02/25727269520/in/album-72157664017913913/&#34; title=&#34;mingun-shinbyu-low&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1443/25727269520_e4bb00c242.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;281&#34; alt=&#34;mingun-shinbyu-low&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Shinbyu celebrations&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another very evidently drunk man offered us watermelon slices as we stood watching the ceremony. I took one in order not to be rude. He would demand money for it later but a rebuke from his wife would make him hasten to return me the money I offered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip #3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drunk men are simply drunk men, no matter where you are. Stay clear or deal politely, latter being more amusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had spent close to half an hour watching the ceremony before we decided to get going. We had come only half of the 40 odd kilometers between Mandalay and Mingun. We rushed on the well tarred roads and after passing some more pretty villages, reached the spot along the Irrawaddy that was chosen for one of the most ambitious projects in the world. We bought tickets to for the Mingun-Sagaing region (worth 5000 MMK) from one of the counters and went further to check out the stupas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parul also bought one of those conical cane hats that she had been fancying for a while and went into the next level of her Burmese mode. She liked to believe that she was &lt;a href=&#34;http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/kungfupanda/images/e/ea/Dream_po.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150830221231&#34;&gt;Po&lt;/a&gt; but then who doesn&amp;rsquo;t!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1567/25933246511_0152d12460.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Parul : Burmese Level 2&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Parul : Burmese Level 2&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mingun_Pahtodawgyi&#34;&gt;Pathodawgyi&lt;/a&gt; is a remarkable sight. It was intended to be a 150 meters tall stupa with two massive lions sitting on the eastern entrance. Due to a prophecy that the king would die when the stupa was completed, the project was abandoned and stands as an incomplete reminder of the grandeur and superstition of yore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg borderedimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1622/25933246471_aeb5ebbf95.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Imposing Pathodawgyi&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Imposing Pathodawgyi&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We walked around its compound, straining our eyes to see the cracked walls of the monument in the blazing sunlight. The immense stupa had been ravaged by the earthquakes of 1839 and much of the structure had cracked or collapsed. Wilderness laid claim to portions of the monument with tall grasses and bushes growing out of cracks in the ground and the building. Parul even saw (and I heard) a snake slither past near where we were. By her description, it was green rat snake. We tried finding it again but it had run away into hiding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1632/25395229874_d937ee4871.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Selfie in the blazing sun&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Selfie in the blazing sun&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A warning said that climbing up the stupa was dangerous but since there was a proper staircase built, we decided to climb up all the same. The bricked surface of the monument was scorching and we tried finding respite in any shaded spot that we could find. At the top of the stairs a group of boys were idling around smoking cheroots. They &lt;em&gt;mingalabar&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lsquo;ed us as we passed and asked if we could get a few pictures clicked with them. We obliged with a laugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects of the earthquake were much more evident up top. The entire surface was broken up and had collapsed into itself. Bushes grew out of every crack that afforded enough space. We walked to one of the ends (northern one) and took in the view. It was quite a vantage point and we could see the nearby lands sprawling around. The Mingun Bell and Hsinphyumae Pagoda lay to the north.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;View from up top&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did not bother with the rest of the sides as the heat was getting unbearable. We carefully found our way down the stairs and went back to collect our shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went and saw the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mingun_Bell&#34;&gt;Mingun Bell&lt;/a&gt; next. This massive bell is more than 90 tonnes in weight and rings when it is struck. It was meant to go with the huge stupa next to it but when the Pathodawgyi was abandoned, the bell slowly passed into delinquency. We spent a few minutes playing around it. There were a lot of people, tourists and locals alike, clicking pictures and hitting the surface with wooden pieces to make the bell ring.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Mingun Bell&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next to the bell was the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hsinbyume_Pagoda&#34;&gt;Hsinphyumae Pagoda&lt;/a&gt;. It is a white pagoda which is built in a very different style from the other pagodas. The terraces represent the mountain ranges going up to Mont Meru. The view from up top was nothing exceptional; we had seen a better view from the Pathodawgyi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent some time loitering around and clicking pictures and then went down to get our scooter and headed back towards Sagaing. On the way we stopped at a place for lunch. They were not serving food for some reason. We could not understand why but maybe it was because of the time, too late of too early. They did have some really awesome coconut buns though. We ate a plate of those and they filled us up enough to survive till the evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;innwa&#34;&gt;Innwa&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to skip Sagaing. We had had our fill of pagodas and stupas in Bagan. We decided to go to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inwa&#34;&gt;Innwa&lt;/a&gt; instead. Innwa was the ancient capital of Burmese kingdoms from the 16th to 19th centuries. The earthquake of 1839 (the same one that cracked the Pathodawgyi) completely destroyed the place and the capital was then shifted to Amarapura. We biked back to Sagaing and then took the Innwa bridge to the east of the river. This time we headed south and came across a stream. The ruins of Innwa lay on the other side of this stream. There was a boat service that offered to take us and the bike for a reasonable return fee of 1000 MMK per person/bike. The other option for seeing Innwa was to rent a horse cart on the other side. We thought about the proposition for a bit and decided to take the horse cart. Parul had been fascinated by it since Bagan and this would be a place as good as any to try it out. We bought two return tickets and boarded the boat with a few other tourists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the minute we were at the other side of the small stream. We got off the boat and our place was taken by other tourists returning from their tour of the ancient capital. We walked on ahead and there appeared a big &amp;ldquo;horse cart stand&amp;rdquo; with many drivers offering to take the new tourists out to tour Innwa. They said that seeing the place would take four hours on foot and two hours by the cart. The cart would take us to four main spots. Since we had already decided to take the cart, we quickly booked one for the price of 5000 MMK per person. The horse cart set out down the dusty path through the lanes of Innwa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg borderedimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Horsecart ride in Innwa&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Innwa seemed like a forgotten part of history. There was a small village in place of what must have been a bustling capital. The road from the boat jetty to the walled city was a dusty one. The horse trotted at ease, the driver not hastening it for speed. Somehow the cart seemed to fit right in with the surroundings. It seemed but natural to be seeing a place as antique as Innwa in a mode of commutation as outdated as the horse cart. We came upon the gate of the walled city at length and were greeted by a narrow tarred road. The driver turned the cart along the road, leaving behind the gate. Confused, I asked him why we had not entered the gate and he told me in the broken English that he could muster that he was taking us to a pagoda that was ahead. Now this was something that I found rather disappointing. Had we been on our own, we would have stopped at places, checked out the boards telling about the history of the place. The lack of this freedom was why guided tours sucked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We crossed the southern length of the walls, going further eastward and then turned south for the first stop : &lt;strong&gt;Yadana Hsimi Pagoda&lt;/strong&gt;. This was a pagoda in ruins with not much to see. The derelict Buddha statues and the worn our bricks of the pagodas looked quite different from the gold coated statues that we had seen thus far. A huge tree south eastern corner of the compound added to the authenticity of the ruins. We walked around for five minutes and then went back to the horse cart. At this rate, we would be done in less than two hours. Hiring the cart did not seem like a good decision anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next site, however, changed our opinion a bit. This was the &lt;strong&gt;Bagaya Monastery&lt;/strong&gt;. We were asked to purchase tickets here. This 10,000 MMK ticket was for the Mandalay archaeological zone and would take care of Amarapura and Mandalay Palace as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myanmar Tip #3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always carry a good amount of cash on you when you go for sightseeing or are entering a new town. You never know when you might be asked to purchase a ticket, and they are rarely cheap!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The monastery was made of teak wood, in a fashion rather similar to other monasteries that we had and would see. It was raised on stilts and a description said that the biggest teak pillar was 60 feet in height! We walked around the underside of the monastery to inspect the teak pillars, all of which were pretty wide. Then we went up the flight of stairs to the monastery and were quite blown away by the beauty of the wood work. Both, the outside and the inside of the monastery contained some exceptionally well done wood carving. I knew that Burma was the land of teak but this kind of craftsmanship in wood was unparalleled in what I had seen till date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took our time walking around the monastery building, taking pictures and enjoying the beauty of teakwood. I saw a few monks around, each partaking in some chore related to the monastery. Though it did not seem like an active monastery, there was probably one in the surrounding buildings. Or maybe the monks came around to help in the upkeep of the building. When we left the building, it seemed that the tour might take the two hours after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We rode back to the walled city in the horse cart, entering it from the western gate. At the gate we had departed from the tarred road once again and the horse ambled on the dusty path again. An occasional house presented itself between the farmlands. We did not cross any structure reminiscent of the former glory of the capital. In a distance we could see the &lt;strong&gt;Nanmyin Tower&lt;/strong&gt;, a knocked up watchtower that was the sole survivor of the royal palace of Innwa. Everything else had been flattened by the earthquake. We rode past the watchtower, pausing momentarily to read the history and take a few photos. Climbing the tower was prohibited since the staircase (and probably the tower) was no longer in a state to take strain of tourists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg vertimg borderedimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Nanmyin Tower&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We rode on to the &lt;strong&gt;Maha Aungmye Bonzan Monastery&lt;/strong&gt; nearby. It was also called the &amp;ldquo;brick monastery&amp;rdquo; because the brick architecture that set it apart from the other wooden monasteries. This one did not have exquisite artwork of Bagaya Monastery but it looked impressive in its own sense. The building was huge and built to replicate the wooden monasteries. The yellow complexion of the structure lent a beauty to it that was highlighted by the mellowing sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took a quick tour of this monastery and then returned with the horse cart to the stream crossing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;u-pain-bridge&#34;&gt;U Pain Bridge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a little time to sunset and there was a bleak chance that we might make it to Amarapura in time. We hopped on the bike and raced to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U_Bein_Bridge&#34;&gt;U Pain Bridge&lt;/a&gt; as was marked on Google Maps. We crossed a gathering of people watching a live football match but regretfully could not stop because we were planning to be done with the bridge that day. As we left the highway to take the bylanes of Amarapura, the scene grew less rushed. Groups of men played &lt;em&gt;chinlone&lt;/em&gt; every few meters while some people were wrapping up the day&amp;rsquo;s work. Sunset marked the end of the working day for the people of Burma. They believed in leading a fulfilling life rather than slogging all day long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reached the U Pain bridge a little later than what we had planned. All that remained of the sun was a bleak afterglow, but the cloudy sky had rent the setting sun invisible anyway. There were a lot of people on and around the bridge. Some were very clearly tourists or jaywalkers. Others seemed to be walking on the bridge as a matter of daily routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were at the western end of the bridge that sported a pagoda and a lively bazaar. This was clearly the place where tourists came to see the bridge. We went down to the banks of the lake first. People were taking boat rides in the lake. The water looked unclean but that was to be expected with so many people. We clicked a few shots which came out rather well. There was an awful lot of thrash all around though that was difficult to ignore. The lake did not smell however. We also saw a photo shoot going on; a model dressed in white and black being pictured on top of a dead tree trunk. Must have made a rather weird picture for what seemed to be the name of a chic magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Thrash all around the bridge&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it got darker, we climbed on the bridge and decided to walk it&amp;rsquo;s length and back. U Pain Bridge is considered to be the world&amp;rsquo;s longest teak bridge at a length of 1.2 kilometers. It is quite amazing to behold. The wood of the bridge looks in good shape despite it&amp;rsquo;s age (it was built around 1850). It sways a little under the incomprehensible weight that it is subjected to but it does not seem weak in any way. There are small resting points built all along the way, small benches and shades to rest a while or enjoy the view. It was all dark when we were up on it and there was no view to enjoy. There was barely a breeze blowing and the mosquitoes started bothering the minute one stopped. We crossed a few resto-bars built on the lake&amp;rsquo;s surface which seemed like a nice place to stop for a beer or two. But perhaps when the weather is less oppressive and the evening younger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We bought a lighter on the other side of the bridge and walked back smoking a cheroot that we had acquired earlier that day. We somehow consumed half of it and left the rest. It seemed like an extremely large beedi. A shorter one would have been appreciated but such a large one was too tasteless and seemed to be a pointless exercise. Yet everywhere you looked in Myanmar, there were people smoking these abominations and chewing beetle. The nation was consumed by these products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two and a half liters of petrol that we had filled the machine with were not even half consumed after the day&amp;rsquo;s trip. We were already pissed that the hotel had given us such a run down machine and no petrol for such an extravagant price. We decided to ride around the Mandalay Palace a couple of times before returning the bike. The palace looked eerily beautiful lit up in the night. The moat reflected the watch towers beautifully. On the southern wall there was a light and music show going on with fountains and all. Locals and tourists were to be seen leaning on the railings watching the amusing show. We saw a few vehicles going inside the palace gate and decided to go check it out. A military officer stopped us hurriedly as we approached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;We weren&amp;rsquo;t allowed by this gate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which gate then? The man pointed to his left. East gate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes. East.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;But the palace is closed now. Tomorrow morning. 8 AM to 5 PM.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah. Okay. We smiled and rode back to the main road. Laughing that he might have been laughing at us. Stupid tourists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;cycling-in-mandalay&#34;&gt;Cycling in Mandalay&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went to see the Mandalay Palace the next day. We got up and had the awesome breakfast that the hotel was offering us for free. Then we got bicycles from the hotel. We did not have a huge distance to cover and it seemed like a more reasonable option than renting out the motorbike again. The bicycles, however, were just as run down as the motorcycle had been but we managed somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ticket we had bought the previous day worked at Mandalay Palace. The inside of the palace is all restricted area except for the central palace. We rode past training grounds and lodgings. It seemed a curious sight. We rode around the main palace and entered it from the western gate. Going opposite to the usual flow would remain a recurring thing in our sightseeing. From this side, we hit upon the Palace museum first. We looked at the relics and exhibits for a while and then went around the palace.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Palace quarters&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As opposed to the outside of the main palace, the inside was free to move. There was no guard or military man restricting your movement. You could go anywhere that the doors were open. Signs warned you where shoes were to be taken off; banners described buildings; the watch tower offered an amazing view of the palace.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;View from the watchtower&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We walked around for a bit and clicked photos, accidentally walked in on couples having a private time in the backyard of the queen&amp;rsquo;s maids&amp;rsquo; quarters, selected the most suitable quarter for residence, imagined and envied the daily routine of the royal family. Then we got a couple of glasses of sugarcane juice and pedaled out of the palace the same way we had come in. A couple of hours was all that was required for the palace and we had spent that much time here.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Funny?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sun was bright and harsh by now. We went to the Mandalay hill and parked our bikes next to the staircase. This was one of those few places where you had to pay to store your shoes. We did and started walking up the stairs. There were quite a few pagodas all along the staircase to the top. Parul&amp;rsquo;s research had told us that there was one pagoda worth seeing, the &lt;strong&gt;Kusinara Pagoda&lt;/strong&gt;. This was also supposedly a little difficult to find. After the second flight of steps, there was a board with vague letterings declaring Kusinara on the left. That wasn&amp;rsquo;t so difficult to find! The stairs to the left led down again and almost at the base level we hit upon a gate that led into a room with golden leaves, owls and lizards painted on white walls. The colour combination looked very different because of the staccato bursts in which the colours came. A wooden Buddha face looked on with a mix of ecstasy and knowledge on his face. Another door led us to the inner chamber.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Wooden Buddha&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The walls continued the same pattern but the corridoors were now arches. The floor was tiled with brown swastikas and the lamps shed a very becoming yellow light in the room. We walked in and to our right a Buddha statue was doing what seemed to be the best thing to do in such a setting; lay down and rest your head on your arm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sat down under a fan and decided to enjoy the coolness of the room. The sun had been harsh and hot outside. Kusinara offered us a much needed respite. There was no one else around. Just two young girls who practiced their English on us. They asked us our names and country. Told us their&amp;rsquo;s. When I asked, they explained that the school was off for the summers, which was why they were running around in this place. They were quite fascinated by Parul&amp;rsquo;s thanaka.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Burmese kids&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talked to them and clicked a few photographs for the next ten to fifteen minutes. Then we decided it was time to get off our lazy asses and continue the climb to the top of the hill. As we were leaving, a few more tourists trickled in, never too many in number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We slowly climbed to the top, breaking to watch little boys attempting stunts with &lt;em&gt;chinlone&lt;/em&gt; or eating raw mangoes and drinking water. We crossed many statues and pagodas en route. Some had big Buddhas, some small; each in a different posture and stance. There was the famous statue of Buddha pointing towards Mandalay, prophesying the coming of a great city in that area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg vertimg borderedimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Prophesying Buddha&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good thing was that the entire staircase was shaded, else I doubt we would have made it to the top! The pagodas got a touch of glass work towards the top. The Buddhas were replaced by various other deities, probably survivors of older faiths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg borderedimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Glassy pagodas&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we made it to the top, we realised that it was nothing exceptional. It might have be better during sunset but in this season it was the haze that killed the view, whatever the vantage point. You could see most of Mandalay from up here. The Irrawaddy on the west was also clearly visible. To add to our frustration, we had to pay 1000 MMK for the summit! We had bought a 10000 MMK ticket for Mandalay area but the hill top demanded an extra 1000 MMK? It seemed rather ridiculous but we did not debate. We were too tired to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were approached by an Indian man. His name was Mahatma and he was third generation Burmese. His grandfather had been brought from India to work on plantations by a rich Indian landlord who had been gifted land in Burma. Since then his family had been in these parts. He was working in the jade industry now, and seemingly had come a long way from the position that his grandfather had found himself in. He was happy to meet Indians but had not visited India too often. Just four times in his life. His nephew, Abhay, had never been to India. He was there at the hill with his relatives. We were all introduced and talked a bit. He told us a little about the city and the preservation of the Hindu culture in the country. After some time we took his leave and retraced our steps down the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;With Mahatma and Abhay&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the bottom of the stairs we sat down at a small shop for some food and more sugarcane juice. The food was another &amp;ldquo;Oh my God!&amp;rdquo; instance. Our hostess filled us up with food. I had ordered beef curry and just that had a spread of 7-8 bowls! Parul had shan noodles which were pretty good again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myanmar Tip #4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always wait for your ordered dishes to be laid out before you order more. You never know how many complimentary dishes might be on the way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the awesome lunch, we grudgingly returned to our cycles that were parked across the street and slowly pedaled to the pagoda and monastery complex to the immediate south-east of the Mandalay Hill. Parul had done some research last night and found out that these were the more interesting of the pagodas in the city. It was after four and although the heat was letting up a bit, our full stomachs had dulled our enthusiasm to see pagodas. However, the first of the lot, &lt;strong&gt;Kuthodaw Pagoda&lt;/strong&gt;, seemed quite interesting. It was supposed to have the world&amp;rsquo;s largest book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg borderedimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1684/25398612153_0fdcec2542.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Startree and satellite pagodas&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Startree and satellite pagodas&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We approached Kuthodaw from the east and seeing an entrance, parked our bikes there. A man demanded 100 MMK for the bikes. Who the hell charges for bicycle parking! Anyway, we paid and went inside, leaving our footwear on the gate. We completed a circle of the pagoda. It looked beautiful. There were several tourists, a 123 year old star tree, beautiful white satellite pagodas sprawled all around the main one, but we did not find any book! I was supposing that the world&amp;rsquo;s largest book would be easy to spot. Confused, Parul asked me to check if she had not been mistaken about the name of the pagoda. Google offered a clue. Someone, in his reviews, had written that the book is set in stone. We rushed to the nearest white sub-pagoda and sure enough, instead of a Buddha image that is to be seen usually, there was a stone tablet with the book inscribed on it. We were standing &lt;strong&gt;IN&lt;/strong&gt; the world&amp;rsquo;s largest book!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg borderedimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1697/25398612523_8c0c0537bb.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;World&#39;s largest book&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;World&#39;s largest book&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Parul took photos, I went to the Western gate to collect our footwear since we would leave for the next site by foot from the southern entrance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myanmar Tip #5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever you can, carry your footwear along inside a pagoda. Though letting it be on an entrance is usually safe, you might not want to leave from the same entrance that you came in. Also, carrying a plastic bag to keep the footwear in makes it easier to handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite happy with our discovery, we left for the next site from the southern gate. Our stupidity became evident now. There were signs speaking about the inscriptions and guides explaining the stone tablets to the tourists. It was much more obvious on this side. Next, we walked to the &lt;strong&gt;Shwenandaw Kyaung&lt;/strong&gt;. This was a monastery similar to the one in Innwa. But the woodwork was much more detailed and beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg borderedimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1657/25727383520_272840b968.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Shwenandaw Monastery&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Shwenandaw Monastery&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was active restoration work underway in good taste. Inside there were carvings of Jataka stories well preserved. We saw signs that prohibited women from climbing into the main chamber in the monastery. Burmese culture was not without it&amp;rsquo;s misogyny!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Not quite egalitarian&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next and last stop for the day was &lt;strong&gt;Sandamuni Pagoda&lt;/strong&gt;, which was supposed to have the largest iron Buddha. We made a circle again but could not figure out where the largest iron Buddha was. We let it be and stopped to see the sun setting over the satellite pagodas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg borderedimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Sunset at Sandamuni&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a bunch of Europeans nearby (seemed French to me by their language) who were clicking photographs and talking aloud. A young monk passed by and I saw him do a few double takes. I thought it was because he was disdainful of one of girls wearing her slippers on the pagoda. Parul told me that it was because two of them were kissing while they got their photos clicked! Such absurd disregard for other people&amp;rsquo;s sentiments can be a result of an unparalleled cultural arrogance. I was even more sure now that they had been French.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;booking-tickets-nightlife&#34;&gt;Booking Tickets &amp;amp; Nightlife&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were considering Hsipaw or Hopin (Indawgyi Lake) for our next destination. I had inquired about the tickets on the way back to the hotel from the Mandalay Hill trip but they had told me that the tickets for Hsipaw were over and the ones to Hopin would be available the next day from 6 AM. I was sure I had read about advanced bookings of tickets but if the counter was turning me away, there was no reason to suspect otherwise. Since Hsipaw would mean wasting another day (the train to Hsipaw runs at 4 AM in the morning), we chose Hopin instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was up at 5:30 AM and was at the station counter five minutes before 6 AM. The counters were not yet open and the staff was preparing for the day&amp;rsquo;s work. People had already started waiting in lines. Not knowing which line to get in, since all the sign boards were in Burmese, I approached one of the counters and asked the gentleman inside where I could get tickets for Hopin. He stopped what he was doing and helped me very patiently, telling me the available options and the times they would reach Hopin. I chose the 10 AM option and the man pointed to another counter on the other side of the hall. The counter read &lt;a href=&#34;http://globalnewlightofmyanmar.com/myitsone-mandalar-express-down-train-launched-maiden-trip-from-myitkyina-kachin-state-on-22-december/&#34;&gt;Myitsone-Mandalar Express Train&lt;/a&gt; and was not open yet. But there was a line in front of it and I joined it. I waited till 6:15 before asking the person behind me what the opening time was. He told me 7 AM. A long line for more than an hour! I decided to go back to the hotel since it was nearby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg vertimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1544/25395474834_e84fd45feb.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Early morning queuing at ticket counter&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Early morning queuing at ticket counter&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parul and I returned around 7:30 AM to inquire at the counter. There were only ordinary class tickets left. The upper class was sold out. We asked about sleeper trains and the man told us to go back to the main counter. We went there and were told that the sleeper train would depart the next day. We chose to spend the day in Mandalay rather than take the ordinary class and spend a day recuperating in Indawgyi. We bought the tickets which were all written on a piece of paper. The man used carbon copier for records which was kind of funny to remember. The fee was 17,800 MMK per person, not exactly cheap. This was approximately INR 900 for a 500 km journey! This was way more than what the trains here should have been worth. Anyway, with our tickets booked, we quickly found another hotel to spend the night and shifted base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had another OMG meal at a Chinese place, &lt;strong&gt;The Pyay&lt;/strong&gt;. It was not your typical noodles and dumplings Chinese. This was quite different and extremely delicious as well. This was probably the most defining feature of Mandalay for me. The food was an amalgam of cultural influences from all the adjoining states. There was a bit of Shan, Kachin, Burmese, Chinese, Indian and what not to be found in the food here. You needed but to roam the streets and stop at any place (street side or otherwise) that piqued your interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Awesome Chinese lunch&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the evening we walked till the &lt;strong&gt;Jewelery Market&lt;/strong&gt;, only to find it closed. It was dark by the time we walked back and we saw the street side food joints cropping up. Some of these shops have a dish installed on a cart and a TV put up against a light pole. People huddle next to these makeshift entertainment arrangements. It is really quite amusing and ingenious.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Roadside entertainment systems&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could see an EPL match starting as we passed some of the joints; Arsenal vs. Tottenham Hotspur. Today promised to be a lively night. Myanmar loves it&amp;rsquo;s football, especially the English Premiere League. We decided to go sit in a beer station near our new hotel. This was &lt;strong&gt;Shwe Lat Yar Beer Station&lt;/strong&gt; on the junction of 82nd and 31st streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myanmar Tip #6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mandalay and Yangon are well planned cities. Just the street number is usually enough to get you around in downtown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sat at the beer bar having some super cheap draught beer (only 700 MMK per glass), eating some starters and bitching about the pathetic level of football in the EPL. The only reason it is such a hit in the Asian markets, according to me, is because of they time it to air at our prime time. There is no other reason that someone would waste his time watching such bad football!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we were about to wrap up, a man came and pulled a chair up to our table. He introduced himself as Salman, half Indian and half Burmese. He was communicating in uncertain Hindi and managed to tell us that he owned a lungi shop in Mandalay. He also said that I looked European (well&amp;hellip;). We paid our bill, shook Salman&amp;rsquo;s hand and got up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were not done yet though. Parul wanted a picture of the lit up watchtowers of the palace reflecting in the moat. We walked all the way, happily drunk and making plans to do an MC Hammer Slide once we got there. But the trouble was that neither of us knew how to do it. No issue, YouTube to the rescue! We saw a funny video and tried out the hilarious steps once we got to the palace, laughing and wondering if the towers held snipers to shoot drunken idiots performing buffoonery in front of the palace. Parul finally got her photo as well and we returned to the hotel giggling like kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is about the final leg of my road trip from Delhi to Pune via Madhya Pradesh. Read about Day 3 &lt;a href=&#34;http://grasskode.xyz/post/delhi-pune-day-3/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;vidisha-to-dhule-sanchi-stupa-typhon-breaks-down-dining-hall&#34;&gt;Vidisha to Dhule, Sanchi Stupa, Typhon Breaks Down, Dining Hall&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started relatively less early the next morning. The &lt;strong&gt;Stupa&lt;/strong&gt; at Sanchi would not be open before sunrise so we had decided to leave by 8 AM. I had to fix the idling RPM of my bike which had somehow reduced, so I got the bike out of the parking lot and opened it up. For some unknown reason the guys at RE had decided to make it thoroughly inconvenient to fix a thing as simple as this. BBC came back with his bike and we had a silly fight with the parking attendant over 10 rupees. It ended with us paying him an extra 10 bucks, him calling us liars and me shouting at him while he walked away. Finally I fixed the Typhon&amp;rsquo;s RPM, shut it up, withdrew some money out of an ATM, had breakfast at a street-side stall, and reached Sanchi by 9 AM. We bought a couple of tickets and a couple of delicious guavas. After eating the guavas we rode a winding road up a hill and parked our bikes in an empty parking lot. The cloak room was not open yet so we asked the guard if we could leave our bags with him. He agreed and so we dumped our bags, got our tickets stamped and went inside the &lt;strong&gt;Stupa&lt;/strong&gt; complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/140507143@N02/24893488220/in/photostream/&#34; title=&#34;sanchi-stupa-1&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1473/24893488220_eea50357a5.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;281&#34; alt=&#34;sanchi-stupa-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Entering the Great Stupa complex&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason the history text books had always given me the impression that the &lt;strong&gt;Stupa&lt;/strong&gt; was situated on a lowland and would be overcrowded with tourists. On the contrary, it was situated on top of a small hill which was chosen specifically for the quietude it offered that was necessary for monastic lifestyle. A bit of history :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stupa was commissioned by &lt;strong&gt;Asoka the Great&lt;/strong&gt; of the Mauryan Empire in the 3rd century BC and the construction was overlooked by his wife, Devi, who belonged to Sanchi. During the next two centuries, under the &lt;strong&gt;Shunga&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Satavahana&lt;/strong&gt; periods, the Stupa was adorned with the &lt;em&gt;toranas&lt;/em&gt; (gateways), balustrades and the canopies, as well as the Stupa 2 and 3. Many more temples and monasteries were added over the centuries as the site continued to be an active site for Buddhist activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Approaching the Great Stupa&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally found the &lt;strong&gt;Stupa&lt;/strong&gt; very exquisite. The artwork on the gateways was extremely detailed and impressive. Plus there was a detailed explanation of the artwork and the stories they represented, mostly Jataka stories. I spent quite some time looking at the artwork on all the &lt;em&gt;toranas&lt;/em&gt;. There were not many tourists around. Perhaps it was too early in the morning, or maybe it was the middle of the week. Whichever the reason, I enjoyed the peace till a loud group of Tamil aunties came, got all worked up and started conversing in loud voices. Then we moved away from the Stupa to and went on to explore the ruins of the monasteries and temples. The sun was up and the heat was slowly cranking up. We sought the shade of a large tree and sat under it hoping the attain enlightenment alike &lt;strong&gt;Buddha&lt;/strong&gt;. The conversation drifted towards &lt;em&gt;yogis&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;sanyasis&lt;/em&gt; who master their bodies to an extent of being able to defy nature. We had heard stories of people who lived in the mountains, surviving in the extreme cold without food and water. But was it a myth? Did such people really exist? If so, where could one find them? We contemplated the questions for a while and then gave up the futile exercise to go explore more temples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After having seen most of the &lt;em&gt;vihara&lt;/em&gt;, we decided to get a cup of coffee and then leave our own separate ways. The &lt;strong&gt;Stupa&lt;/strong&gt; more or less marked the end of our trip. From here, BBC would go back to Vidisha, thence to Jhansi and home to Agra. I would continue towards Pune, covering as much distance as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this definitely was not the end of my adventure. The few kilometers till Bhopal went by easily enough. The day was still young and not many vehicles had taken to the road. From Bhopal onwards, the highway got much better. It became a one way, 4 or 6 lane highway and allowed me a decent amount of speed. I was planning to reach Dhule by the end of the day. This would make my next day easier, leaving just a few hours of travel to Pune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/140507143@N02/24562380953/in/photostream/&#34; title=&#34;mp-roads-6&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1525/24562380953_963dc801a7.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;281&#34; alt=&#34;mp-roads-6&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;One-way highway to Indore&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the change of highway quality and was making quite good time. Around forty kilometers out of Bhopal, I crossed the village of Dodi and decided to stop under a tree to rehydrate and take a short break. Once I was ready to leave, I found that my bike was unwilling to comply. It was the &lt;strong&gt;EFI&lt;/strong&gt; (Electronic Fuel Injector) again! I tried all the tricks I had learnt in the previous months, hoping that it would be one of the older problems that had resurfaced. But nothing worked. The battery was okay, the handle twisting did not activate the EFI, the wires seemed fine. I was at the end of options, so I tried calling the phone numbers of the workshops in Indore that were listed online. None of them picked up. I did the only logical thing I could, I dragged the bike a kilometer back to Dodi and asked for a mechanic. I was not expecting to find a RE workshop here but something would be better than nothing. The mechanic was one of the rare type that actually listen to the customer rather than acting like a know-it-all that most of the RE mechanics are in a habit to do. We started looking for the fault and failing to find it, decided to check the EFI. He pulled a wire directly from the EFI to the battery and it buzzed alive. So the EFI was not faulty. Phew! That was good news. Since the mechanic did not have time on his hands, he suggested that he could make a direct connection for the EFI and I could get the wiring checked in Indore. Though I would have liked to get the wiring check then and there, he said he would not be available for another couple of hours at least and assured me that I would be good for the distance till Indore. While I contemplated and he taped up the wires that he had opened to inspect, I asked him if there could be a fault with the engine switch on the handle bar. I switch it off and on nonchalantly and lo and behold! The EFI had started working without a direct connection! I swear I will never understand Typhon! At times he just seems like a moody woman that I am stuck with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to simply accept that something had worked and not shake things up any further. I learnt how to make a direct connection just in case I needed to do it further down the road. Then we closed everything the way it was and I resumed down the highway towards Indore. I had lost just an hour in this ordeal and could still make it to Dhule by the end of the day. Perhaps I would have to drive an hour or so in the dark but it would be worth the effort the following day. I stopped on the Indore bypass for some lunch. It was a proper restaurant instead of a highway &lt;em&gt;dhaba&lt;/em&gt; but I thought I would allow myself this luxury. The decision was regrettable. The waiter brought a chicken &lt;em&gt;biryani&lt;/em&gt; instead of the mutton &lt;em&gt;biryani&lt;/em&gt; that I had ordered. On top of it he decided to argue that he remembered what I had ordered while I did not. Then the owner decided to charge me more than the price given in the menu. When I asked him what that was all about, he told me that the prices had increased and the menus had not been updated. I was quite frustrated and decided that the twenty rupees was definitely not worth the time. So I paid and got out of the restaurant fuming and furious at being cheated; the value being of no relevance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was three in the afternoon and the sun was glaring down on the earth. The heat was getting to my head and I was feeling a little uncomfortable. I broke up the remaining kilometers in chunks and milestones. I took a break at every milestone and refreshed myself with a tea in case a stall was available, or with some water and shade. One of the tea stalls had a rather curious owner. He told me that I reminded him of a biker friend of his who was in the army and was currently posted in Goa. Elsewhere I rested my tired back in solitude. The sun went down slowly and the heat lessened. I crossed the border to Maharashtra while the sun was low in the western sky. Dhule was not much farther away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/140507143@N02/24893593700/in/photostream/&#34; title=&#34;maharashtra-1&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1630/24893593700_7ce02abc96.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;281&#34; alt=&#34;maharashtra-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Entering Maharastra to good highways&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was close to Dhule when it got dark enough for the headlights to be switched on. In another hour, I was at my destination and stopped by the streetside to check if there were accommodation options listed online. A bike stopped next to me and asked me where I was coming from. Thus began another conversation with two young men who were curious about who I was and where I was coming from. They were even curious about the price of the bike and then the salary I was earning. I gave them satisfactory answers and some dampened figures. In return I took a recommendation for lodgings. The recommended lodging was a bit too expensive for a water hole. So I decided to go further inside the city. An &lt;em&gt;auto-walah&lt;/em&gt; gave me another recommendation and I followed it. This one was within my budget and I checked myself into &lt;strong&gt;Lodge Comfort Inn&lt;/strong&gt;. While I was entering my details in the register, two more Marathi men asked me about my trip thus far and my plans further. They were a bit more thorough and asked for more details. I gladly answered them, the conversation was nothing I was averse to. Then I went up to the room and got out of my riding gear. I rested a while and then went back down to grab a bite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had some disappointing bhel and then went to a dining hall that the owner of the guest house had recommended. This place had a long waiting line, and I had to wait for almost twenty minutes! Usually I do not wait this long for food but I was quite curious as to why people were thronging this particular dining hall in a big city like Dhule. While I waited, I noticed that Dhule had a lot of Hindi speaking population. I guessed it was because of it&amp;rsquo;s proximity to the state border. When my turn did come, I went and sat and was served with an unlimited meal. It totally justified the price, though not the wait. No food is worth such a long wait, in my opinion. Never the less, the simple meal was quite delicious and I ended up overeating! But I still bought a bowl of &lt;em&gt;srikhand&lt;/em&gt; at the end and lapped that up as well. I suffered from the pleasurable discomfort of an overstuffed stomach as I walked back to my guest house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/140507143@N02/24821534489/in/photostream/&#34; title=&#34;dhule-chetna-2&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1604/24821534489_3f13a2fa81.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;281&#34; alt=&#34;dhule-chetna-2&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;A primer to the tasty vegetarian thali&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once back, I tried sleeping and managed to in a short while. The day had been long and tiring and the trip meter had read 1668 when I parked the bike. The blanket given seemed unwashed since ages and I decided not to use it. But the mosquitoes forced me to cover myself up with it despite my hesitation. I have little recollection from the remainder of the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;dhule-to-pune-shirdi-madness&#34;&gt;Dhule to Pune, Shirdi Madness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up the next morning and was glad not to have contracted any skin ailments. I quickly changed and checked out. I left the main highway (NH3) and took the detour to Shirdi. The main highway was going to continue to Nashik and thence to Mumbai. I stopped here for some breakfast. Good old poha and masala dosa! Then I resumed the journey on the two way highway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/140507143@N02/25070974822/in/photostream/&#34; title=&#34;maharashtra-3&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1459/25070974822_1ac5e17631.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;281&#34; alt=&#34;maharashtra-3&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;NH3 out of Dhule&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highway was quite well made and the traffic was easy. However, as I neared Shirdi, I could see a lot of people walking on my side of the road. Initially it did not strike me but these people were walking a length of more than 5 kilometers, making a pilgrimage to the Sai Baba temple! They had choked the street to a near halt and support vehicles slowly moved with them, taking up another lane of the road, blaring loud music and distributing packets of water to the devotees. The used up packets were thrown on the roads and made for an impressive sight. Things people do in the name of devotion. I somehow managed to cross the few kilometers till Shirdi town. Here people started popping out and coming uncomfortably close to my bike, offering parking spots and hotel rooms. Hoarding announced budget lodgings and various kinds of food preparations. I have developed a strong disgust for such commercialised religions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Shirdi, I took a couple of more stops and was in Pune before two in the afternoon. It had been a short day and I was left with enough time to rest my tired body. The trip meter gave me a total of 2021 kilometers since Delhi. The distance felt like an accomplishment of sorts. I celebrated the rest of the day doing nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would spend the coming week repairing Typhon, taking care of some professional commitments and wondering if I had rushed the road trip too much. Madhya Pradesh had been amazing. It was probably one of the more underrated states. There are a lot of historical gems there but they are unfortunately not widely promoted. It would take some time to explore the place. And for the lack of any state transport, it can be best explored by the road on a vehicle of your own. Of course the traffic is a little crazy and you risk the buses and trucks running you off the road, but hey! That&amp;rsquo;s part of the adventure, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do recommend a bike trip, if you have the time and appetite for it. Riding is an experience of it&amp;rsquo;s own. I have not yet come up with a convincing argument of my own as to why one should ride. So, for the time being, I will redirect you to a post that my friend wrote about our &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.devashish.me/2016/01/04/riding-across-the-thar/&#34;&gt;road trip through the Great Indian Thar desert&lt;/a&gt;. The opening paragraphs list some compelling reasons of why one would, in his sane mind, choose to ride on two wheels rather than four.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>

&lt;p&gt;I had visited Hampi last in the October of 2014. It is a quiet village in the heart of Karnataka, close to Hosapete and Ballari. I had really liked the place back then; something about the laid back idleness of the place giving me a much needed break from my hectic schedule and the lack of mobile network only adding to the peace. Three days had gone by in a jiffy and there was a feeling of incompletion when I boarded the bus back to Pune. So when the opportunity presented itself for a return to this charming town, I had no reason to turn it down. The excuse : a half marathon being organised by a group that called itself &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.goheritagerun.com/&#34;&gt;Go Heritage Run&lt;/a&gt;. I signed up for the run and made the necessary travel arrangements. Parul was coming with a group of her friends from Pune. We were going to make a vacation of this long weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-to-hampi&#34;&gt;Getting To Hampi&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hampi is a quaint little town that does not have much more than history to boast of. The rustic neighborhood is accessible via road. Perhaps the easiest way to get there (unless you are driving down directly) is to get to Hosapete and then catch a local bus to Hampi. Hosapete is quite well connected by rail and road. Majority of the bus services operating in Karnataka have Hosapete on their map. Or you could catch a train to the Hosapete station. The latter being by preferred mode of travel, I looked up the available options and found a seat in the slow passenger train from Bangalore to Hosapete. Since I was in no rush to get to the town, the passenger train worked out pretty well. It would get me to Hosapete around mid noon and it would take me another hour or so to get to Hampi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had spent a rather hectic week in Bangalore, rushing around to meet friends, catch up on pending correspondence, working on a couple of projects, etc. I was looking forward to some time out without any agenda on my mind. There was more hectic travelling and running around that would ensue immediately afterwards, so there was all the more reason to savour this time the best I could. I boarded the train at Bangalore Central railway station. The coaches of the train seemed to be arranged at random which made finding my coach a little painful. I eventually did find the coach and dumped my luggage. The train started shortly after and I retired to my berth. I prefer the upper berth; it is like a private nook of your own in a chaotic train cabin. The simple sleeper compartment can get specially noisy and stuffed but there is some inkling of privacy in the upper berth. This one, however, was not too clean. Someone had thought it a good idea to climb up with his muddy shoes! I somehow arranged my backpack to cover the muddy part and lied down without thinking too much of the dirt. It was nothing that a bath could not cleanse me of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a tough time falling asleep because of my throat infection. It had been troubling me intermittently for quite some time now and medications barely help me. I slept a restless sleep, waking up from time to time to adjust myself. During one of these bouts of consciousness I realised that the night was over, people had started waking up and moving about. Faint morning light was struggling to light up the compartment but the upper berth was the secure in the safety of it&amp;rsquo;s remoteness. I eventually woke up when Parul called to tell me that they had reached Hosapete and were going to Hampi. The clock said 9:30 AM and my train was supposed to reach in another couple of hours. I stretched and made my way down. The train had been standing still for a while now. I went out to check what the matter was. Instead of the 10+ bogies that had crossed last night to find mine, only 5 stood on the platform with no engine on either end. The random arrangement of the compartments made sense now. The train had split up at Ballari and while most of it travelled on to Hubbali, a few compartments were left behind to be towed by a diesel engine till Hosapete. After a fairly lengthy break, an engine attached itself to one end of the abandoned bogies and we resumed our journey. The weather was rather pleasant and I enjoyed the wind and views that the journey had to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;http://grasskode.xyz/images/hampi/train1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Train Journey&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Onwards to Hosapete&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;http://grasskode.xyz/images/hampi/train2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Railway Tracks&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Track Gazing&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The train got us to Hosapete a few minutes earlier than the appointed hour. I turned down the auto-rickshaws that offered to take me to the bus-stop or Hampi and walked the couple of kilometers to the bus stand. After a small and quick meal of keema and parotas, I boarded a bus to Hampi. Currently route numbers &lt;strong&gt;301&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;302&lt;/strong&gt; ply between Hosapete and Hampi. This bus was quite crowded with the local students who came from the surrounding villages to study in the schools and colleges of Hosapete. I spent a few minutes studying the hands of a young woman who was crammed up next to my seat and had to hold the window railing right in front of me for support. There were three dots of ink on the back of her hand at the base of the thumb; perhaps a mark that had been given to her as a child. The boundaries had blurred over the years and now lacked in sharpness of a fresh tattoo. I had not seen the woman but her hand indicated that she was quite young. The skin lacked the creases of age. Dirt trapped near the tips of the fingers suggested that the hand was subjected to outdoor work. I fell asleep contemplating the kind of life that she must have led. Within a few minutes of leaving Hosapete the crowd started easening and I woke up to find that the hand had left my presence sometime during the journey. We reached Hampi soon after and I picked up my luggage and deboarded the bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.goheritagerun.com/&#34;&gt;Go Heritage Run&lt;/a&gt; management had set up the bib collection at the end of the Hampi Market. I walked up to them and gathered my bib. No RFID implying no timing of the run. I liked the idea. I immediately walked back to the river jetty and took a boat to the north of the river. The Tungabhadra was flowing at a serene pace and a usual crowd had gathered on the banks to bathe in it&amp;rsquo;s waters. I got off on the other side and walked along the main road towards the guest house. The north of the river is something of a small hippie village with a profusion of foreigners, mostly Israelis. The place had gotten more crowded and new cafes and lodgings had cropped up in the year and a half that I had last seen it. Numerous shop owners offered bikes and scooters for rent as I made my way to the guest house. I found Parul and Aamir relaxing in hammocks, the rest were on their way. I took a quick bath, freshened up and lay in a hammock as the remainder of the party streamed in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once everyone had taken a breather, we decided to hike till the sunset point. There was a small temple up on one of the rocks nearby and we had seen a beautiful sunset from there the last time. En route, however, an enterprising young man, who went by the name of Venkatesh, sold us a few cups of tea at bloated prices and told us about another sunset point that was much more popular and where people apparently jammed. Sounded interesting and since everyone was up for it, we set out following young Venky to the other point. Turned out that it was at the other end of the village and included a decent amount of climb. We found a good spot that offered an exquisite view of the Virupaksha Temple and Matanga hills on the other side of the river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The green paddy fields down below reflected the sky beautifully. The sun stay hidden behind the clouds for quite a while and was mellow by the time it reappeared in the sky. We spent a good couple of hours there, enjoying the view and indulging in activities of personal taste - photography, music, reading, etc. Towards the sunset the crowd thickened and the place lost it&amp;rsquo;s serenity. We left shortly after the sun had set. There was still a little brightness to be availed for the climb down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent the rest of the evening eating some unexceptional food in &lt;em&gt;Top Secret River View Cafe&lt;/em&gt; and listening to some good music. With a tiring day behind us and another one up ahead, I decided to retire early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;running-around-hampi&#34;&gt;Running around Hampi&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alarm woke me up at 5:45 AM. I quickly washed up and went to check on the others. By 6:15 AM five of us - Trupti, Parul, Aamir, Bhargava and I, were making their way to the river side to catch a boat to the other side. My run began in 30 minutes. The boats had not yet started plying and a lone coracle was making it&amp;rsquo;s rounds in the dark waters of the Tungabhadra. The asking price was an exorbitant INR 100 per person but we realised that we did not have an option at the moment. So we allowed ourselves the extortion and found ourselves on the other side of the river with five minutes to spare for the run. Fortunately the run was delayed by a few minutes and I made it to the start point right in time for the flag off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The air was cool and pleasant and the sun had not yet made itself visible when we started running out of Hampi. The path curled into an intimidating incline immediately outside Hampi market but gradually planed out. The police were helping out with the arrangement and the run seemed to be well managed. There were not many participants in the 21K category that I had signed up for and I, for one, enjoyed running without the crowd that usually throngs such events. We ran on the tarred road, passing ruins on either sides. A pleasant orange sun rose in the eastern sky while we passed through the verdant surroundings. The traffic was easy and, but for an occasional rowdy truck driver, the route seemed quite safe. The track was an out and back one and we took a U-turn near Vitthala Temple. Here we ran into quite a few 5K runners who had taken a different (shorter) route. Aamir and Bhargava were running this category but I could not spot them. I took my first break right after the U-turn and hydrated myself. I was doing better than I had expected of myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;http://grasskode.xyz/images/hampi/vitthala.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Stone Chariot at Vitthala Temple&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here on I encountered a lot of runners coming from the opposite direction. These were the ones of the 12K category. A few 21K runners overtook me but I did not feel the inclination to compete with them. I was not competing for position. I usually ran with a target time as personal goal but this time around I was not too keen on the time as well. I was doing this to check my fitness level and to renew the determination that a half marathon requires. I had been out of practice for quite a while and knew that my physical form was lacking. I was just looking to complete the run in the vicinity of 2 hours. I have always believed that timing depends on one&amp;rsquo;s physical form whereas completion is more about the mental form. The route back was a bit more taxing. I kept my pace and stopped when I felt too tired. The weather was quite helpful and so was the scenic route. A langur looked on from the roadside, surprised at so many humans running with nothing to chase! I eventually crossed the finish line and a rough calculation told me that the time had been around 1:55. Not bad; not bad at all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aamir and Bhargava had completed their run a little while back and Adityo had joined the group in the two hours I had been running. We met Chris who had participated in the 21K as well. We chatted for a while, cooled down and had some of the breakfast that the management had arranged. Then we headed back to the guest house to take a bath and stretch our limbs. Back in the guest house I took a bath and went and relaxed in the cafe. The service was slow but none of us were in a rush. Chris came around and told us about the bicycle trip that he had done the previous day around Hampi. Seemed like a good idea but it was not a possibility on that day. My legs were not up to the task. After lunch everyone went their own ways. Some went exploring the ruins of Hampi, some lounged around in the cafe, I went back to the room for a nap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parul woke us up around 4:30 PM. We hired scooters and went to the Sanapur Lake. This lake is another charming aspect of the north side of the river. You can spend hours there swimming in the cool waters, lying on rocks and looking at the sun travel across the sky or taking a coracle ride in the lake. To our surprise, the lake had very little water this time. Parul was astounded since she had come here a mere two months back and found the lake full to the hilt. The water level had gone down by more than a few meters! Which meant that our usual spot which offered a great swimming space was out of question. In fact swimming did not seem like an option at all. We searched for and found a spot a little ahead of the usual one. This area would have been completely submerged with the usual level of water. Cameras and GoPros came out and were set up for hyper-lapse photography. The sun was already behind the boulders on the far side of the lake and the sky bore a reddish tint. We sat for a while, talking and listening to music. Some climbed up rocks and played pirates. Minutes flew by and it was dark by the time we started wrapping up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;http://grasskode.xyz/images/hampi/lake.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Sunset at the Sanapur Lake&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aamir said that this was a perfect setting for a horror movie. Ten people lost in the woods in the dark and then people suddenly start disappearing. Though none of us disappeared, the darkness was not really helpful. I could no longer see the lake and was guiding the party out with a certain amount of uncertainity. The moon was not yet up and the darkness was near complete. Our feeble torches did little to help, but we did manage to find our way out successfully! Though some complained of hearing sounds in the bushes, everyone was out without incident. Encouraged, we decided to continue the adventure and take the long route back. A near-full moon had risen in the sky as we slowly made our way through the villages and fields. But for a single wrong turn, which was immediately corrected by the villagers, we did alright this time. The roads were unlit and uncrowded, the air cool again; we rode in silence with the only sound being the hum of our engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended the day with some good Indian food at a cafe right next to our guest house. This place (Rasta Cafe) was not too crowded and the service and food were pretty good. Back in the guest house, we retired early once again to recover from the taxing day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-day-in-ruins&#34;&gt;A Day in Ruins&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We woke up without much of an agenda the next day. A few had woke up early to go watch the sunrise from the Hanunman Temple but Aamir, Parul and I had opted out of the plan. We slept till 10 and then got up and made plans for the day while having breakfast at Rasta Cafe. The three of us agreed on renting out bicycles on the other side of the river and exploring the ruins around town. After breakfast we caught up with the others and started off with them. Bhargava was also interested in renting the bicycle while the others were of the opinion to spend their time in a less hectic manner. We crossed the river on the boats and while we waited for the others, I got the (now familiar) &lt;em&gt;firang&lt;/em&gt; treatment. A couple of guys asked me my name and pronounced it with an anglicized accent (something like &lt;em&gt;Karen&lt;/em&gt;). It was probably my attire : a white kurta on top of knee length shorts, but I have gotten mistaken for a foreigner from time to time. It is a rather amusing study in our well known xenophilia. People walked up to me and offered me some rice puffs! They would never have been so gracious had they seen me for the Indian that I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once everyone had managed to cross to the south of the river, we split up. The bicycles were short in supply and exorbitantly expensive! I haggled to a lower price but it was still too costly. Anyhow, we got four geared cycles and set out to explore. The climb right outside Hampi market got everyone. Most of us were new to geared cycles and unable to use it properly and efficiently. The weather was hotter than the previous days and the sky was clear. The glaring sun did not help our situation any but we kept at it and the road gradually got smoother. We rode at an easy pace and the traffic was not a problem. Within a few minutes we reached the ruins complex that we had set out to see. While we were locking up or cycles, the others made an appearance in an auto-rickshaw! So much for separate ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first stop was an underground Shiva temple. It was underground in the sense that the temple&amp;rsquo;s top was at the current ground level. The temple was not an active one; very plainly built, without much adornments on the walls. After the outer chamber, the base was covered in a layer of water a couple of inches deep. The water seemed stale and a strong smell of bat droppings invaded our nostrils. The inner chamber had a very &lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones-ey&lt;/em&gt; feel to it. Bats fluttered around and light was scant. On the other end of the inner chamber was yet another chamber. This was the main chamber with a &lt;em&gt;shiva linga&lt;/em&gt; inside that was visible only if the entrance to the inner chamber was unobstructed! I have seen such use of natural light before and am totally in awe of such architectural styles. All of us roamed about for a while and then left the temple. A glass of lemon soda to refresh ourselves and onwards to the next site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next site was a open area that used to be the Mohammadean residence. We could go inside with our bikes and so we did. There was a watch tower up ahead and we rode up to it. Riding on tracks is so much fun! As expected, the watch tower was closed. Indians have a tendency to lock up places and restrict movement. Anyway, we rested a while, listened to some music and then left for the next place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hazararama temple was quite a delight. In a grand style that is typical to Vaishnavite temples, it was well sculpted and adorned with impressive artwork. The walls of the temple told the story of the Ramayana in short. I tried to follow some of the murals that I could make sense of. Perhaps the name of the temple was derived from the numerous Rama images that were present on the temple walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left for the Zanana Enclosure next. This was a well maintained compound to the north of the Hazararama temple. There was a ticket for this complex with the standard rates of INR 10 for Indian citizens and INR 250 for foreign nationals. We talked about the disparity of the rates but it seemed fair that the beauties of the land be accessible to all it&amp;rsquo;s citizens and offered to outsiders at a price. The Zanana Enclosure contained the famed Lotus Mahal and the Elephant Stables. The stables were grand and imposing, befitting the beast it must have harboured in the times of yore. The Lotus Mahal seemed an exaggeration; it was neither much of a mahal nor resembled a lotus very blatantly. Perhaps the petal arches of the gateways were what gave the structure it&amp;rsquo;s name; or maybe the curling extension of the roof that lent the structure a somewhat floral touch. I could not find any text explaining the significance of the Mahal so I can guess at best. Apart from these, the complex contained a temple that we skipped, the basement of the queen&amp;rsquo;s palace that was quite ordinary, a museum that contained quite a few intriguing relics and a couple of watchtowers that were quite quite beautiful and seemed right out of a video game (Age of Empires) I used to play!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were running short of time to explore the final area that lay to our south. This was the Royal Enclosure and had seemed quite crowded. We decided to skip it and go to Kamlapur instead. We needed to withdraw some money for our expenses, there being no ATM in Hampi. Kamlapur was less than a kilometer away and we quickly finished our business and headed back to Hampi. The undulating roads seemed less tiring this time around but we were still exhausted by the time we returned to Hampi Bazar. We returned the bicycles and decided to grab something to eat before catching a ferry to the north side. Bhargava and I munched on some gobi manchurian (a South Indian delicacy :P) and a plate of masala rice. Then we joined Parul and Aamir in &lt;em&gt;The Mango Tree Restaurant&lt;/em&gt; for some &lt;em&gt;lassis&lt;/em&gt;. Our stomachs at ease, we set out to cross the river with the last minute traffic. The sun was mellowing down and would soon disappear from the sky, leaving an orange afterglow, which in turn would give way to the night&amp;rsquo;s darkness. After lot of pushing and shoving we managed to get to the other side and returned to the guest house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;au-revoir-hampi&#34;&gt;Au Revoir, Hampi&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning was mostly spent packing up and seeing the folks off. Bhargava was riding back on his KTM Duke. Adityo was driving Trupti, Kapil and Priyanka back to Pune. We were delayed somewhat by the utterly unprofessional behaviour of the guest house manager. Parul had made reservations beforehand and a mail chain had recorded the confirmation of five rooms at a fixed rate. The manager blatantly refused the arrangement, saying that he had never agreed to the rate and that his rate was more than what was mentioned in the mail, which, as per him, he had specified in a phone call. We tried to make him understand that it was utterly unprofessional to simply raise the rate for a prior reservation at whim, but when he said something to the effect of &amp;ldquo;You pay me what I want&amp;rdquo;, I knew it was a lost cause. We paid him, put up a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g319725-d2458962-r342724341-Gouthami_Guest_House_Vista_Rooms-Hampi_Karnataka.html&#34;&gt;review on Tripadvisor&lt;/a&gt; and left with a sour taste in our mouth. Unfortunately his business will continue to flourish despite what we had experienced. We go where the rates are cheap. Who cares about unprofessional conduct by a manager?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We killed some hours in Rasta again. Yes, we were definitely in love with it. We lazed around and watched a movie. I worked on my writing. We even played a game of pictionary!

&lt;/p&gt;
By 3 PM we had decided that enough time had been killed. We paid our bills and walked down to the river jetty to cross to the other side. Then we had a lunch at &lt;em&gt;The Mango Tree Restaurant&lt;/em&gt;. The food here was quite good, though a little expensive. After lunch we caught a bus back to Hosapete which got us to the town uneventfully. Then we saw KK and Ruta off before catching up with Chris in front of our bus stand. We spent the remainder of the hour at a juice shop, chatting in general and drinking fresh fruit juice. Our bus made an appearance and we boarded. We were off to Pune with all it&amp;rsquo;s city bustle. So long, Hampi&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
