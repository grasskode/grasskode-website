          <description>

&lt;p&gt;I took a fairly new passenger train service from Phnom Penh to Kampot. I had been recommended Kampot strongly earlier in my travels and I had decided to put it on my list. I had planned to stay in this small riverside town only a couple of days before heading further towards the islands but I ended up taking my time to enjoy what the sleepy town and it&amp;rsquo;s surroundings had to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;lazing-in-a-sleepy-town&#34;&gt;Lazing in a Sleepy Town&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The train halted at Takeo within 2 hours of departing from Phnom Penh. It was a small station with a few vendors selling food. I got off and walked about taking some photos. I was getting a little hungry as well so I bought some chicken and rice which I ate on the train once it resumed it&amp;rsquo;s journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Halt at Takeo&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sunset was barely visible since the train was heading due west. The beautifully lit up sky over the paddy fields was a sight to behold. I did not know that the windows could be opened up so I contented myself by clicking the sunset through the dirty windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8549/29423660100_9e2806d93b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;train-sunset&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Sunset from the train&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The train reached Kampot before the expected time. I got off and caught sight of the only other foreigner there. We approached each other with the intention of sharing a &lt;em&gt;tuk-tuk&lt;/em&gt;. But there was no &lt;em&gt;tuk-tuk&lt;/em&gt; around so we decided to walk till the main road. This guy lived in Bangkok now but had lived in Kampot for a while sometime back. He suggested I go to Kep which I pocketed in the back of my mind. We found two &lt;em&gt;motodops&lt;/em&gt; while walking and decided to take those. I got a drop next to &lt;strong&gt;Magic Sponge&lt;/strong&gt; and the other guy went to the riverside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Koko had recommended this guest house to me. It was a tad bit over my budget but I decided to give it a shot for a night at least. The owner told me that they were full when I walked in. I told him that I had made a reservation to which he quickly handed me a key and told me where the bed was. He was in a hurry because of some quiz event that was to take place in the restaurant that night. I went up the stairs as he had directed and came upon the &amp;ldquo;dorm room&amp;rdquo;. It was a shaded terrace with beds laid out in rows. Proper beds and not bunk ones. I really liked the setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8035/29088340854_ebdb2c9674.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;magic-sponge-dorm&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;The nicest dorm&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a few French people around but we did not talk much. There was a loud periodic sound though which we could not figure out. Another girl came in later, Bed 6, and I asked her if she knew what was making that sound. She off-handedly told me that it was Jeremy, the residential &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokay_gecko&#34;&gt;tokay gecko&lt;/a&gt; making mating calls. We tried looking for it but he was hiding somewhere in the dark. It would have been cool to spot it though. These geckos can be almost a foot long!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I headed out to withdraw money from an ATM. The ATMs here dispensed up to 500 USD in a transaction which is a huge amount but I took all of it to avoid paying ATM transaction fees repeatedly. One can always use the USDs. I then proceeded to find some dinner but the food options were limited since it was after 9 PM. This town slept earlier than Phnom Penh. I sat in a street side stall to eat some noodle soup. They were also selling something that they called &amp;ldquo;sweet&amp;rdquo; which was a mixture of sprouts, jellies, &lt;em&gt;son-papdi&lt;/em&gt; and condensed milk. I would have tried it had I had a sweet tooth. üç¨&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dinner I sat next to the river a bit. This town was nice to spend a couple of lazy days in. But I had not decided what I was going to do after this. I wanted to go to Koh Rong Samloem but I might not have enough days to do that and Otres. My head was all messed up. I went back to the hostel in a while and slumped into the bed. Eitan and Daniel were in Kampot as well. This being their last night here, they messaged me to ask if I wanted to hang out but I was too tired to go out and was generally feeling lazy. I gave it a pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;dorm-room&#34;&gt;Dorm Room&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up late the next day and worked a bit on a blog post. I had some well made Eggs Benedict for breakfast in the guest house&amp;rsquo;s restaurant. This place was really nice and well within reasonable budget. Unfortunately I was travelling on a shoestring. I went to the riverside and sat on a bench there. This was to be &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; bench by the riverside for the rest of my stay in Kampot. By some stroke of luck, I always found it free whenever I went for a stroll by the river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;View from &#34;my&#34; bench&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spell of rains sent me seeking for refuge in a cafe nearby. I sat sipping on a mango smoothie and read some brochures about the area to kill time. I had thought of a vague itinerary for going to &lt;strong&gt;Koh Rong Samloem&lt;/strong&gt; and returning to do &lt;strong&gt;Bokor mountain&lt;/strong&gt; before heading back to Phnom Penh. But the brochure changed most of it. Kep seemed to be a really nice place. There was a national park there which caught my fancy. I went back to the hostel to think at leisure as to what my plan further would be. Two of my dorm mates, the English girl in Bed 6 and the French girl in Bed 3, came in later that afternoon and helped me finalize the itinerary. Bed 3 had recently been to the islands and told me that the weather was a tricky factor at the moment. I helped Bed 6 plan her upcoming Vietnam trip as well. Dorm room symbiosis at work. üôè&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later that afternoon, the English girl that I had met in Phnom Penh checked into the same dorm and we exchanged hellos. Neither of us remembered the other&amp;rsquo;s name but we did not bring it up. She was in Bed 2 and that is as good a name as any. üòù She had done Bokor that day and told me it was quite an adventure with all the rain and fog. I suddenly realised that once again I was in a dorm where I was the only guy! I could get used to this. üòé It was much better this time since none of the girls were a messy teenager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted a break from all the confusion and effort of itinerary planning so I decided to walk around. I headed to a spot marked on the map as Lily Pond. The pond was not the greatest one; the water was a bit stale and the lilies were not the most beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8442/29423611550_dcab24de48.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;lily-pond-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Lily Pond&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a few boys playing football on one side and I asked if I could join them. They said yes and so I put my bag down and joined in. None of them spoke much English but we got by. Some were good while some were adorably bad. It drizzled for a while but we played on till it was almost dark. I talked to two of them who sat next to me while I was putting on my shoes. They were school kids ranging in age from early to late teens. They studied on weekdays and played on weekends. Seemed just about right!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ate in one of the street side places near the river. The food was cheap and good. I tried something called the &lt;strong&gt;Kachay Cake&lt;/strong&gt; which is similar to a &lt;em&gt;tikki&lt;/em&gt; in India. It is even served with a sweet and tangy sauce much like &lt;em&gt;sonth&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8077/29088270604_d96b5cbb2c.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;streetside-food-kachay-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Kevin liked Kachay cakes!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I went to the cafe that Bed 6 had raved about. They had good donuts, so I got one of that and a glass of Vietnamese iced coffee as dessert. I walked back to the hostel skipping through puddles that had accumulated after the intermittent rains. There was just Bed 2 in the dorm room and we got talking. She was going to Vietnam as well so I gave her some tips. She then told me about Bokor mountain and an abandoned water-park near Hue. She has a thing for abandoned places and her travels usually revolved around them. She even told me about some &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.travelog.me/bangkok/10_incredibly_creepy_facts_about_bangkoks_ghost_tower/&#34;&gt;Ghost Tower&lt;/a&gt; in Bangkok and when I looked it up, I had been staying not hundred meters away from it! Then I told her about the train I had taken to Kampot. She loved train but still had not known about this service. ‚úå&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-midnight-adventure&#34;&gt;A Midnight Adventure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started working as more of the girls trickled in. I had been working on getting through a huge backlog that had piled up and at long last I was through with it. I decided to celebrate by going for a late night stroll along the riverside. It must have been 10:30 PM and I decided to leave my bag so that I could just enjoy some time without carrying any baggage (literally). The town had slept and the streets were dark. I did not find it unsafe though. The only ruckus was from some of the drunk old expats which abound in Cambodia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent almost an hour sitting on my bench and enjoying the cool breeze. The recent rains had made the weather very pleasant. I started back for the guest house around 11:30 PM. I came back to find the main gate locked! I hoped someone would be around but no one was. I spent a good amount of time shouting hello&amp;rsquo;s and knocking on the gate. Nothing stirred inside. I was thinking of ways to get in and for the first time I noticed that the walls of this place were really high and topped with barbed wires!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in a state of disbelief that they would lock the door like this without anyone being around. The riverside bars stayed open till late night and people must come in at all times. I was struck with another brilliant idea. I looked up the number of the guest house online and called the number. I could hear the phone ringing inside and was hoping someone would pick it up. There was no way people had fallen asleep so quick. But no, nothing happened. I gave up after two tries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was left with few options. I was hoping someone would come by after a late night out and would know how to get in. But that could take forever and of course there was a chance that there was no one having a late night out. I could also find another guest house to sleep in for the night if nothing gave but finding a guest house this late would not be easy. I was contemplating climbing the wall on the neighbouring complex and then crossing the boundary wall which was not all that high. I was about to give it a shot when I saw a few motorbikes approaching. I hoped that they would know how to get in. They seemed to be at an equal loss. One of the guys had left his bag in there and had come to fetch it. Since they did not have any bright ideas, I told them to look out while I attempted crossing from the neighbouring complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a good thing that I have been scaling walls and doing stupid things since I was a kid. I needed all that training to get in. The rains and moss had made the surface a little slippery. The last jump was a little precarious as I had to jump a little ahead of some pots immediately under me. I managed to pull it off without twisting my ankle. Phew! I checked the reception door and it was locked so I told the guy and he said he would pick up his bag in the morning. There was a sign that said that I was to use another gate for late nights and so I went up, panting, itching and a bit flustered at the entire event. This had not been my idea of celebration. Everyone was already asleep and I washed up and went to bed. I slept to the sound of rain pattering against the window. Fortunately I had not been locked out for the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I brought up the closing time with the owner the next day. He told me it varied and I asked him what one was to do if he came late. He simply told me that one of the keys given to me were for the main gate. Awesome! So the only time I decide to leave my bag behind, I happen to need it all the more. Anyway, I checked out and then went to the &lt;strong&gt;Captain Chim&amp;rsquo;s Guesthouse&lt;/strong&gt; where Eitan had told me of the 3 USD dorms. It was a little run down but it served the purpose. The first thing I did after checking in was to ask for the closing time of the main gate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-side&#34;&gt;Other Side&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found a one dollar place to eat. The food here was good and ample so it was actually a good find. I shared the table with a girl and we got talking. I told her about my room switching and she told me about the hostel she was staying in - Monkey Republic. They seemed to have 4 USD dorms that were much better value for money than the ones I was staying in. Plus it was right next to Magic Mushroom. Meh! I told her about the train service from Kampot to Phnom Penh but she had already booked a bus. Sweet revenge. üòá We left our ways after food. It is interesting how I have lost the urge to ask for names. It does not really matter and I tend to forget them anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had initially planned to rent out a motorbike and go to Kep or Bokor but the better part of the day was gone. It was close to 2 in the afternoon so I spent some time dawdling by the riverside instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8315/29679385696_5613cbc840.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;riverside-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Strolling by the riverside&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I happened to remember a place that Bed 6 had told me about and decided to go check it out. It was around 8 kilometers out of town so I thought I would use this as an excuse to get some exercise as well. I rented out a bicycle from the hostel and set out for &lt;strong&gt;Greenhouse&lt;/strong&gt; upstream on the other side of the river. The bike was in a rather dismal state. It was supposed to be an MTB but the gears did not work and the tyres lacked the required pressure. And this was the best one I could find from the lot they had. I was expecting to ride through the countryside but it turned out to be a highway. There were quite a few trucks and more 4 wheeled vehicles. People looked at me curiously as I passed them by sweating and panting on my bicycle. Some smiled at me when I caught their gaze. I smiled at everyone I saw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8374/29423575500_bdf5f6f5a7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bikeride-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Country highway&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had underestimated how long 8.5 kms would be. The undulating roads and humid, wind-less weather had me tired on the gear-less and airless bike. The last 750m or so was a muddy track that was all slushy because of the recent rains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8118/29423555210_8ec2175db7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bikeride-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Mud trail to Greenhouse&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found Greenhouse and parked my bicycle inside. Their friendly big black dog greeted me at the gate and wanted to smell me up, thus getting into my way of putting the bicycle on stand. The cafe was pretty amazing as well. It was right on the river and there was a bunch of people sitting around. I was not up to socializing so I stuck to sitting by myself, drinking a couple of beers, writing and eating some delicious Fish Amok. There was a platform right under where one could go take a dive in the river. I had my swimming trunks on but I lost all determination once I was actually there. üòû There were a few people swimming in the river but I stuck to the cafe. I need more confidence in fresh water; I need to practice swimming some more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left after an hour or so. The ride back did not seem all that hectic. Maybe it was slightly downhill or maybe it was the two beers in me; who knows! I bought a padlock in the town to lock the cupboard in the dorm room. I had been carrying a lot of weight in my backpack because I did not have the means to lock the stuff in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip #13&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carry a padlock with you if you plan to stay in budget dorms. The lockers in budget accommodations might not always have a lock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came back to the room to find another guy there. He and I were the only ones sharing the dorm room. However, he slept through the evening and night, so we did not get to interact. I went out to eat some Khmer Bread and then came back and worked till it was time for the match. France looked threatening and Ronaldo came off with a knee injury 25 minutes into the game. The match still went into extra time and France missed a number of chances. It was a spectacular goal from Portugal that put them ahead in the second extra time and that was that. Portugal won; they did to France what France had done to Germany in the semi-finals. The entire Euro had been a series of freak football anyway. I was somewhat glad that the tournaments had ended. This would mean that I could finally sleep at regular hours instead of staying up till 4AM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;bokor&#34;&gt;Bokor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I talked to my dorm mate the next morning. He had done the Bokor mountain the last day and all the sleep had been a way to recover. He had been in Kampot for a while now but he gave no direct answer to what he was doing there. I did not push the matter because it did not matter to me. I rented a motorbike and went to the dollar shop to eat. Then I rode out of town towards &lt;strong&gt;Bokor mountain&lt;/strong&gt;. I took the highway west towards Sihanoukville. After 7-10 kms there was a well marked diversion to the right and a gate where I had to pay 2000 KHR (0.5 USD) to take the bike in. The road was well made and I could see the mountain ahead covered with clouds.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Road to Bokor&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hit that patch of mountains a little while after starting the ascent up the hill. The rain was continuous but I had come prepared with my poncho. The roads were well paved and used by an occasional vehicle every now and then. I rode slow and steady in the cold and wet weather. I first hit upon an abandoned house right in front of a big Buddha statue and stopped to take a look. The house was in a much dilapidated state with leaking roof and torn down walls. I had expected it to be a little spooky but it seemed just weird. I waded across the accumulated water on the floor and walked around and out. There was no one around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Abandoned house&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a map after a second checkpoint on the top of the hill. I had come with a very vague plan. I knew that there was a church and an old casino that I needed to see. Other than that I had thought that I would just stop at any place that looked interesting. With a 5 foot visibility that seemed like a bad plan. So I took mental notes of places that seemed interesting on the map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Where are we headed, Joker my man?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rode in the direction of the church. I had ridden past it without a clue and then came back after I checked on the Google Maps. I had to stare hard in the direction where the church was supposed to be to see a faint silhouette that was the building. A break in the roadside suggested a possible entry point as well and I parked the bike along the road and went in. The church appeared out of the fog! This was a little scarier than I had thought a few minutes ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inside of the church had some idols and a lot of graffiti. I walked around and out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8192/29603371522_1002c4bb63.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bokor-21&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Not the most comforting church I have ever been to&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, there was no one around for the entire duration I had spent there. A path led further away from the road and I climbed the rocks to a viewing point which might have been nice on a clear day. Right now it was all white and wind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old casino was supposed to be a little ahead. I got on my scooter and kept on a lookout for any signs this time. A blue board for a parking spot alerted me and I found the casino building to my right, another shadow in the fog. The casino was much bigger and slightly more imposing than the church. There was absolutely no one in the building when I had come in. But one I started walking around on the floors and checking out the rooms, it seemed like a not-yet-inhabited-new-construction rather than an old abandoned building. The fresh cement work and colourless walls were to be held responsible for this. A few people did come in later and I could hear their voices and sighted them a couple of times from afar, but we never crossed paths. Turning around a corner to suddenly find another person might have been more scary than relieving, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Old casino&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rode around a bit to a small pond indicated on the map. It was only after getting to the pond that I realised that I would be able to see none of it anyway because of the fog. There was a waterfall on the other side of the mountain as well and I decided to go take a look. This side did not have rains and the mist was less thick. The falls were nice and voluminous but the water had a dirty yellow-brown hue. I am not sure if that was because of pollution of the recent rains bringing in an exceptional about of sediments. I spent a few minutes there and then headed back down. I was cold and wet and uncomfortable. I was skipping a few things but I was not really enthusiastic about a lake and some farms anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;VIDEO : Bokor Ride&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many more pictures of the Bokor mountain ride in the album at the end of the post. Make sure you check them out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rode back down and saw a few tourists making their way up. I exited the wet zone a little way from the bottom of the hill and removed my poncho. I returned to the town and sat in my hostel for a while to enjoy the warmth of the place. I stepped out again to grab a bite, came back and worked a little and then hit the bed exhausted. There was a heavy downpour outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;kep&#34;&gt;Kep&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning I filled up my bike with some more fuel and took to the road to &lt;strong&gt;Kep&lt;/strong&gt;. The distance is roughly 25 kilometers by road and the well made road means a riding time of roughly 40 minutes, give or take a few depending upon your maximum speed. My dorm mate had warned me that Kep did not have much to do. He said that it was more of a village than the city which it claimed to be. I understood what he meant as soon as I got there. Everything was spread out and there were not enough people around. I rode till the beach and then came back after seeing the famous Kep crab statue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8238/29603153702_d7556fc5ab.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;kep-4&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Welcome to Kep!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to check out the &lt;strong&gt;Kep National Park&lt;/strong&gt; (KNP) but I was unable to figure out how to get on the trail. There were very vague pointers online and I tried a couple of lanes that ended in nothing but a dirt track. I asked around near the beach and another tourist told me that the entry to the park trail is near &lt;strong&gt;Verandah Resort&lt;/strong&gt;. The 8 km long trail circles a hill which is the actual National Park. Verandah Resort was easy to locate on Google Maps so I went there and saw a booth right ahead of it&amp;rsquo;s gates. I parked my scooter there and gladly paid the 1 USD entry fee and walked onto the trail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kep Tip #1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entry to the National Park trail is near the Verandah Resort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8001/29678953776_3fe2d3cd2f.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;knp-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Kep National Park trail&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first stop was the &lt;strong&gt;Led Zep Cafe&lt;/strong&gt; which I had seen in the brochure. I did not have a choice to not go into a cafe with that name!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8744/29678941896_e76ee4fb0c.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;led-zep-cafe-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Some things are inevitable&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a small cafe near the beginning of the KNP trail. It had some decently priced refreshments and a magnificent view of Kep down below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/8/7783/29087825754_f4abd40166.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;led-zep-cafe-4&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Pancake with a view&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also gave me a free map that I used to trace a route through the national park. Led Zep Cafe and an associated Squirrel Association (possibly the same people) had marked the entire KNP with distance markers and directions. It was a truly extraordinary effort by them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8439/29603116152_255017ddc3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;led-zep-cafe-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Signboards all over the place&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They had also cleared several walking routes through the jungle on the hill. I took one of these. The forest was thicker than I had thought and I had to brace some insects and spider nets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8452/29714135055_78c459f448.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;knp-4&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Going in&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KNP is known to have varieties of lizards and snakes. I saw quite a few lizards but did not manage to spot a snake, fortunately or otherwise. The mosquitoes were relentless throughout. They buzzed in my ears and bit me every time I paused even for a few seconds to take a picture, check map or take a breather. I saw many insects and the walk was pretty nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Creepy crawlies in KNP&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went till the top-most point, Phnom Kep, and halted there for a while. This was the only break I had taken since starting on the trail. I was quite tired by the excursion so I decided to take the shortest route back. It was a certain &lt;strong&gt;Jungle Path&lt;/strong&gt; which probably cost me more time and effort instead. A warning said that it was a path only for experienced trekkers but I took it despite my worn out shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;instagram-media&#34; data-instgrm-version=&#34;7&#34; style=&#34; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;padding:8px;&#34;&gt; &lt;div style=&#34; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&#34;&gt; &lt;div style=&#34; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&#34; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/p/BHyek4JhhGg/&#34; style=&#34; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;A photo posted by Karan (@grasskode)&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;time style=&#34; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&#34; datetime=&#34;2016-07-13T04:45:13+00:00&#34;&gt;Jul 12, 2016 at 9:45pm PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The route was precarious indeed! The ropes laid out by the Squirrel Association helped a &lt;strong&gt;LOT&lt;/strong&gt;. They had put in a lot of effort into the small jungle and made it nice and easy for the hikers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8362/29678728136_e4f5d478ea.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;knp-25&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Ropes leading down the tricky path&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After much effort and sweating, being bit by bugs and soiling my clothes, shoes and socks, I finally reached the bottom of the Jungle Route. I ran into a red squirrel whose only part I could see properly was the tail. I was kind of relieved at not having found scorpions or snakes. There was a Little Pond at the end of the trail where I sat to relax a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8408/29602904372_f040d25a26.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;knp-27&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Ideal resting spot&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two guys on a motorbike came along. I hello&amp;rsquo;ed them and they hello&amp;rsquo;ed back. There were Justin and Jerry, both French. Jerry was tripping really hard and most of my conversation was with Justin. He had been to India and knew an awful lot about Hindu mythology. He was into martial arts and wanted to go to Kerala to learn their martial art which, he said, was the source of all martial arts! I had not known that. He had not had the best time in India, mostly because of election campaigns and ripping off. But he was open minded enough to give it another shot. He wanted to go to Pondicherry as well. He was interested in experiencing a place&amp;rsquo;s culture properly rather than fleetingly as a tourist. He was a pretty cool guy. We said goodbye in a bit because they wanted to head to some sunset spot and I had to find my bike at the entrance, almost 4 kilometers away. I started walking on the main track which no longer seemed interesting but I saw some monkeys. üòú&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8459/29713946345_1c1feea7df.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;kep-monkeys-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Monkey see&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to Kep&amp;rsquo;s famous crab market and walked around. The day&amp;rsquo;s business had ended but the restaurants were setting shop and there were many stalls of grilled sea food that looked tempting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8717/29089312603_8a8c41baa3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;kep-crab-market-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Crab Market&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then rode to the other end of the town just to see what it was like. Kep seemed like an extremely spread out and sparsely populated town. The sea-side road from Crab market onwards was quite beautiful. I refuelled and then headed back to the market. I stopped to click the sunset on the Kep beach which is a small and pretty one. Here I  was approached by a Cambodian who thought I looked like a European. We talked a bit and he asked me what the differences between Vietnam and Cambodia were. I did not have much favourable things to say about Cambodia just then though now I think that Cambodia has it&amp;rsquo;s nature and culture much better preserved than Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kep Tip #2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ride along the seaside road during sunset. It is a very pretty sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;VIDEO : Riding along the sea&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the market I sat at a place called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g608456-d6168590-Reviews-The_Democrat_Restaurant-Kep_Kep_Province.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Democrat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They had a sea-side table that looked really nice. I had two of the 50 cent beers and ordered a crab with Kampot green pepper since crabs are the specialty of Kep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Kevin and I enjoyed a beer at dusk&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have crab eating experience or etiquette but I tried with as much sloppiness as I could. The crab was delicious! There were two crabs for 6 USD which is not at all a bad deal. I was full and exhausted by the time I was done. I might need to learn how to eat crabs now! üòú&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Delicious crabs are the perfect end to a day in Kep&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rode back to Kampot in the dark. A slow and steady pace saw me back at the guest house in a little less than an hour. I immediately took a bath and went to bed. I was too tired to do anything and slept soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had initially planned a month long trip in Cambodia but had to shorten it because I needed to rush back to Vietnam. It had gotten converted into something of an extended visa run. Phnom Penh was my first exposure to Cambodia and I noticed a very striking contrast when comparing this country to Vietnam. The few days spent in Phnom Penh helped me understand the whys of it. I went through a series of moving experiences that have helped me appreciate the country better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;nationality-issues-on-a-rainy-day&#34;&gt;Nationality Issues on a Rainy Day&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a handful of chores on my first morning in &lt;strong&gt;Phnom Penh&lt;/strong&gt;. The most important was the reason I had rushed here; I needed to check about my Vietnam visa. But before that, I wanted to get a Cambodian SIM card to satisfy my need for connectivity. The rates varied slightly but I finally got a SIM and mobile internet package from &lt;strong&gt;SMART&lt;/strong&gt; for 5 USD. The internet here is horrible though, both WiFi and 3G. It is only slightly better than Myanmar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked up to &lt;strong&gt;Cina Travel&lt;/strong&gt;, one of the recommended travel agencies to get a visa processed by. Half way between explaining the rates to me, the guy asked me my nationality. To the answer that I was an Indian, he exclaimed a quiet &amp;ldquo;Oh&amp;rdquo; and removed the rate card. Then he told me that the visa processing rate would be a bit higher for me and it would be on a &lt;em&gt;request basis&lt;/em&gt;. This meant that I had to pay more to get the visa and there was no guarantee that the visa would be granted. However, in the case that the visa was declined, I would be refunded the money I paid. I went into my WTF mode. I had just started considering that the entire Indian stigma was within the country and in my head. I sat down to evaluate my options. Applying at the embassy directly was one possible option. But people use travel agents to make the process simpler. If these guys were saying it would be on a request basis, it might actually be a significant task. Also, I doubted that application fees would be refunded in case I applied to the embassy and was declined. Then there was the option of flying into Vietnam and getting another visa on arrival. But this was significantly more expensive. I concluded that I would give it a shot here, and would continue with my original travel plans if the visa was declined. I was not losing out on much since the amount would be refunded to me if the visa was declined. I paid the required 68 USD to put in a visa request for a 3 month single entry visa and hoped for the best. Just for the sake of comparison, it cost 56 USD for Europeans and other &amp;ldquo;Westerners&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought of going to Wat Phnom to make something of my afternoon. Turned out that I was not to see things my way this afternoon. I had barely walked a hundred meters when it started raining. I sought the shelter of a shed over a closed shop and stood trapped there for more than an hour! The rains were coming down relentlessly and the heavy wind blew the lighter drops on me. I took comfort in the fact that I was not the only one who had got caught unaware. The &lt;em&gt;tuk-tuks&lt;/em&gt; stopped to let the sheets down on the side of their carts. The drivers got drenched to keep their passengers dry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8392/29383611165_1c0f240872.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;rains-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Monsoon showers surprising Phnom Penh&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was shifting around to find a spot where the water splashing off the pavement would not get me. The rains were greeted with mixed emotions by everyone I saw on the road. Those that had been caught without preparation were cursing it and rushing away. Those who were better prepared hurried to get their rain jackets on. A few children went past on cycles, getting drenched in the rains and being ecstatic about it as only they could be. I think they are the only ones who whole heartedly welcome the monsoons showers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8309/29275313132_954b028c92.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;rains-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Everything paused&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After more than an hour of standing in the same spot, I started walking back to the hostel when the rain slowed down to a drizzle. Even the drizzle stopped by the time I reached the hostel. I moved my poncho from the main bag to the smaller one in preparation for the next time. I met a few of my dorm mates. The French-Moroccan, who had been there for some time, had got some delicious fruits from a mart nearby and insisted that I try them. He told me that they gave away fruits at discounted rates after mid-noon. The German in the bunk below me was playing his guitar beautifully. I tortured myself when I came to know that he had been practicing for just 3-4 months but then I was at ease when I learnt he was a pianist as well. The Moroccan had been travelling for 3 years now. He stayed put in one place for 3-4 months before moving on. He was trying to learn Cambodian so that he could have a conversation with his girlfriend&amp;rsquo;s parents who had left the country as refugees. The German was in Cambodia for an adventure trip with his brother. This was the end of his trip and his brother had left while he was killing days till his flight was due. He lived in New Zealand before this and did not wear footwear until it was absolutely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone was going to grab some dinner and I decided to join them. There were three new English people who had come in. There was another girl who looked Indian and had an Indian name (Nisha) but flatly refused a connection when I asked her if she had any. Her second name was Polish and that was the nationality she went by. I dropped the discussion seeing her unwillingness and talked to the English instead. The two guys had just spent a month in India and the girl was going there in December. On the topic of brexit, they thought it to be stupid as well. Well then, I wondered, who did find it a good idea? Anyway, since the rains had stopped I was planning to do something. I paid for my food and left while the German and Polish took their time to eat. The Cambodians seem less given to cheating you out of your money than the Vietnamese. That is one good thing about them despite their poverty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;phnom-penh&#34;&gt;Phnom Penh!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally managed to reach &lt;strong&gt;Wat Phnom&lt;/strong&gt;. The sun had set and the rain washed complex was lit up and looked extremely beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to pay a dollar to walk in and was not handed a ticket in receipt. This I did not like but I tried to not let it spoil my mood. I walked around the beautiful complex. There was hardly anyone around. It was a big park preserved in much of it&amp;rsquo;s natural setting with the pagoda on top of a small rocky mound in the center. The pagoda itself was not much to look at but was brightly lit up. There was a massive watch made on the slanting ground on the southern side which was somewhat ridiculous since one could not see the time in it, either from down below or from the top of the rock. I walked around and climbed up to the &lt;em&gt;wat&lt;/em&gt;. There was a modern looking building on the western side which was very oddly not in keeping with the entire nature around. Upon going down I found a sign of &amp;ldquo;Arts and Crafts Center&amp;rdquo; on the gate. It was still under construction but I thought they could have blended it much better with the ambience of the pagoda.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Lovely Wat Phnom&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked out and went to the riverside. I was supposed to meet up with Eitan and Daniel at the night market which was along the river. As I walked towards it, I came upon a dead patch. Apparently the night market is just a weekend thing. I messaged Eitan about the same and we decided to meet at the &lt;strong&gt;Kandal Market&lt;/strong&gt; which was a literal stone throw away from the hostel. I walked back to the hostel to wait for a confirmation from the guys and walked out 20 minutes later supposing that they might be having trouble getting in touch without WiFi. The market was closed but I walked around it to find some interesting food stalls. A bunch of men were sitting and drinking beers and singing songs. One of them was beating a bucket as a makeshift drum. I walked by with a smile. Daniel and Eitan were nowhere to be seen though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8097/29273634342_1883e4afbe.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;market-4&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Street-side delicacies&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally got a message from Eitan telling me there were at some &lt;strong&gt;Snack Bar&lt;/strong&gt; and he sent me the location. It was 1.7 km away on the other side of the tourist area. I was wondering why they did not come to the market as decided and reasoned that maybe they had got lazy. Anyway, I went up to the place but could not find the bar. Turned out that the GPS had messed up! They were right next to the market, maybe a couple of hundred meters, so I walked back to where they were. üòì Eitan bought me a beer for his fuck up so everything was good. üòÜ Snack Bar was a small French owned place. The owner cum bartender was a cool guy by the name of Frank. There were some regulars sitting around and there and there was us. I had no idea how and why Daniel and Eitan had landed here but it did not matter. We joked around, tried learning some Khmer and drank some beers. One of the regulars bought us a round as well! It was really nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left to find something to eat. We had some pork and rice at a street side place that was pretty decent. Then we walked around to find another bar to sit and drink in. Phnom Penh is (in) famous for a lot of reasons and girlie bars are one of them. One of the famous strips was right next to where we were and we walked there to check it out. Curious to know what they were like, we went in one and were hustled by a lot of girls so we rushed out immediately. Daniel felt downright sad for the working girls and Eitan was playing the joker. We decided to try my hostel to see if we could hang out with some travellers but even the hostel was dead. We ended up on the riverside promenade and got a few beers from a bar truck (yes, there is such a thing; think food truck sans the food and with alcohol) and sat by the riverside to drink. The weather was nice and we discussed philosophy, war and politics. These guys were just 24, had been in a war and had experienced things that I could probably never imagine. They told me war was hell but I could not help but feel that a war, irrespective of the scale, should be decisive. I just felt bad for those who had to live day in and day out caught in a war zone with no end to their miseries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finished our beers and decided to check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g293940-d324074-Reviews-Sharky_Bar_and_Restaurant-Phnom_Penh.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharky&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which has the reputation of being the longest running rock n&amp;rsquo; roll bar in Indochina! üé∏ Sharky was a big establishment with only a handful of people. This was not the peak of the tourist season and there are a few &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.travelfish.org/board/post/cambodia/17588_beware--sharky-s-bar-in-phnom-penh-&#34;&gt;bogus reviews&lt;/a&gt; online that might have cost Sharky some of it&amp;rsquo;s prospective customers. I find such obtuse tourists (referring to the review above) insufferable. They have a superiority complex and they have no idea how to deal with issues politely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8288/28760391193_a6a2b0e05d.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;sharky-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Sharky has a slow day&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we played a few games of pool and drank some beers. The music was turned down but they were playing songs that I had never heard played in bars before; I mean, who the hell plays &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xc1PHk9FhIk&#34;&gt;Green Eyed Lady&lt;/a&gt;? üç∫ ‚úå I loved the time there and then we walked out, split up, and headed to our respective hostels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8277/28757917774_3762d44b17.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;sharky-4&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;True story!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;coffee-culture&#34;&gt;Coffee &amp;amp; Culture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up a little late on the next day, mostly because of laziness. I was still sleepy but got out of bed anyway. The bunk bed was so wobbly that I was always afraid I was going to wake up the person below me if I moved. I freshened up and walked till one of the temples nearby, marked on the map as &lt;strong&gt;Wat Ounalom&lt;/strong&gt;. It was in the middle of a residential complex and since I was approaching it from the wrong side (as usual), I missed the entrance the first time around. The &lt;em&gt;stupas&lt;/em&gt; here seemed to be a part of the residential complex. You could see laundry stands sitting between the &lt;em&gt;stupas&lt;/em&gt; or rice strewn around for drying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8396/29381658445_e48a20681b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;wat-ounalom-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Residential stupas&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the annex to the main temple though. The wall that separated it from the main temple had some impressive art of &amp;ldquo;samudra manthan&amp;rdquo; and more scenes out of the Hindu mythological stories. There were statues of Vishnu, Shiva and Bramha with the omnipresent &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayavarman_VII&#34;&gt;Jayavaram VII&lt;/a&gt;, the great Khmer king. It was interesting to see how the Hindu gods had changed in appearance out here, in the shape of their bodies, their postures and demeanour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7557/28760232383_b0889ca440.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;wat-ounalom-4&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Statues and murals&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked around to the front of the temple. The level of detail in all the stone and wood works were mind blowing. I felt that the craftsmanship here was way more evolved than India or Myanmar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8549/29381556135_0ce040ceab.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;wat-ounalom-6&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Impressive craftsmanship&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;tuk-tuk&lt;/em&gt; driver caught sight of me and came around to joke about. He said that the women of his country would love my beard. He was funny enough, but he pestered me all the same. He wanted to take me around to some &lt;em&gt;wat&lt;/em&gt; that had a lot of monkeys and bats. This is a big problem in Cambodia. The &lt;em&gt;tuk-tuk&lt;/em&gt; and motodop drivers think that constantly courting a tourist will increase their chances of making a sale. I find it nothing more than irritating and it tends to have the opposite effect on me. Had he just told me about it and let me think over it, I might have considered. Just because he kept at it, I grew obtuse about not even considering his offer. Anyway, I guess this problem will go away as the country&amp;rsquo;s tourism matures. Currently there are way too many &lt;em&gt;tuk-tuk&lt;/em&gt; drivers; combine it with the poverty and you can understand why things are the way they are. I evaded this guy by going around and exiting through the other side. Then I sat in the nearby coffee shop and had some Khmer bread, a pork bun and a glass of cold milk coffee. The coffee here wasn&amp;rsquo;t half as good as the Vietnamese version!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8321/29381389395_e82f847103.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;khmer-bread-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Khmer bread&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Royal Palace was up ahead and I walked up to it. The &lt;em&gt;tuk-tuk&lt;/em&gt; drivers were quick to tell me that the palace and the museum were closed till post-lunch. Perhaps I would consider one of the many other options that they were providing. I used the excuse of waiting for friends to shrug them off and went to sit by the riverside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8385/28757553514_d1410edffb.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;riverside-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Riverside promenade&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat working on the daily insta update when another &lt;em&gt;tuk-tuk&lt;/em&gt; driver came up to me and started telling me about the options I had for sightseeing. I heard him out but I really needed to get back to my work. I finally managed to push the insta post and shrugged off this &lt;em&gt;tuk-tuk&lt;/em&gt; guy as well. But there were far too many of them. There was still time for the palace and museum to reopen and I thought I could use the time to work. But where? There was a real dearth of &amp;ldquo;sit and work&amp;rdquo; kind of places out here. I eventually decided to go to the &lt;strong&gt;Costa Coffee&lt;/strong&gt; which I had initially skipped because it would be too expensive for my budget. But seeing that I was wasting my time otherwise, I walked up to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Costa üíó&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ordered a large cappuccino and sat writing. An old friend had pinged and I talked to her about my travels as well. Around half past two, I shut the laptop and walked out, debating whether I wanted to go to the palace or not. I eventually decided against it and thought I would go around the palace to the Independence Monument and then return for the National Museum. I ran into Daniel and Eitan in front of the palace gate. They were going to see the silver pagoda in the palace complex and I told them I was skipping it in favour of the museum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked along the road to the south of the palace. There were official looking buildings on one side and a park under construction on another. The &lt;strong&gt;Independence Monument&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;King&amp;rsquo;s Statue&lt;/strong&gt; were in the middle of a vast open space that had a paved surface and some bushes for adornment. There was no tree to break the sun&amp;rsquo;s glare. There were not many people either, just me sweating buckets in the heat and a few people jogging away merrily. I walked up till the monument and took a few pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Iconic Independence Monument&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started walking back towards the museum. It closed at 5 PM and I wanted to get in by 4 so that I had enough time to see it at leisure. The entire area around the palace had beautiful structures which might or might not have been open for public viewing. The walk was quite nice, though the narrow roads and rowdy traffic somewhat limited the enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Sculpting Workshops&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went around looking for the entrance of the &lt;strong&gt;National Museum&lt;/strong&gt; and finally found it right next to the palace. I bought a 5 USD ticket to get in. I remembered having read about an audio guide as well but the woman at the counter denied me one and I was unable to figure out whether she meant there wasn&amp;rsquo;t any guide or they were out of it. Anyway, the reason hardly mattered and I went in. The museum turned out to be really nice. I was glad I chose it over the palace. History and culture is definitely my thing. The museum had some amazing art work from the &lt;strong&gt;Angkor period&lt;/strong&gt;. I got to know a few things about the Khmer empire, its rise and it&amp;rsquo;s outreach during it&amp;rsquo;s best period. Khmer empire was heavily influenced by the Hindu culture from the immediate west. There were several statues and busts from that period which were labelled as Hindu gods and goddesses. It was interesting to see how their shapes and sizes had changed in comparison to their Indian counterparts. All the figures were more rotund and the limbs had a softer touch to them. There was always a slight belly and none of the gods, even the warriors, were fierce in their looks. The most imposing creatures were the &lt;em&gt;garuda&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;naga&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;vanara&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;yaksha&lt;/em&gt;. The goddesses did not have as heavy breasts as the Indian ones and they wore much more generic adornments that made it difficult to differentiate between the genders at times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked at an easy pace, reading most of the descriptions and paying attention to individual articles. There was a transition to some modern art and then a short section for the post-Angkor era where the currently prevalent &lt;strong&gt;Theravada Buddhism&lt;/strong&gt; was honoured. I wrapped up the sections and went into the beautiful courtyard and sat for a while till the closing bell announced the time for departure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8403/28759735603_50239a49f7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;museum-5&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;National Museum courtyard&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was ambling in the museum, I had received a message from Cina Travels asking me to come and collect my passport before their closing time of 5:30 PM. I walked there trying to guess whether my visa request had been successful. The suspense was short-lived though as I reached their office in just 10 minutes. I had a Vietnamese visa for 3 months. This meant that I was going forth with my plan to teach in Vietnam for a month (or more). I walked back to the hostel and collected my laundry on the way. I ate another round of Khmer bread and observed how the locals ate it. It was not to be made into a sandwich as I had been doing so far!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8603/29302048011_c06d76d151.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;khmer-bread-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Kevin approves of Khmer bread!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a bath and sat writing in the hostel. A few new people came in; apparently French and throwing a tantrum about something or the other. I was in no mood for socializing tonight. I had enough work to keep me busy. I stepped out to grab a bite. I ate some rice and &amp;ldquo;cheese&amp;rdquo; from a street-side shop with suspect hygiene. The taste was not too great as well so I left half of it, something that I rarely do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cambodia Tip #4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be specially careful about where you get your food from. The street side places are not as hygienic as Vietnam or India. Try not to get cold things from suspect places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I got a bottle of beer and sat by the riverside drinking it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8132/29346915296_36e1d20d04.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;riverside-night&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Riverside by the night&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The working women were hunting. I politely declined the ones that approached me. Then a man came and sat next to me and started talking. I am not sure what he wanted or if he even wanted anything, but the many references to him thinking that I had money because I was travelling made me quite uncomfortable. I shook his hand and walked away. I walked along the riverside watching people find themselves companions for the night. I ended up in one of the more public spaces with people jogging and working out on gym machines. Some kids were playing with a &lt;em&gt;chinlone&lt;/em&gt; and I sat down to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few Cambodian youngsters were hanging out in the area and I saw a couple kissing a little distance away. I wondered why it is that Indian society is so against love. I had been struck by a sudden epiphany on the bus from Saigon as well. For a country that is obsessed with romance and love songs, there is not much love to be seen in real life. Love before marriage is frowned upon irrespective of whether it culminates in a marriage or not. The society makes it almost impossible for lovers to be together. As an unmarried couple (for we refuse to acknowledge it&amp;rsquo;s existence) you cannot get an apartment to move into together. Expressing love in public places, which is the only resort left to many, draws unnecessary attention and gets you beaten up by hooligans in the name of moral policing. What a bunch of hypocrites we are!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I returned to the hostel after a while and sat down to write. I got to learn a bit more of the Polish girl&amp;rsquo;s story as well. She was actually an American passport holder and had her passport stolen in Siem Reap. She was having a tough time dealing with the embassies and had to bribe policemen to get reports, something that she was clearly not used to. No wonder she was dismissive about her Asian roots because it was what was giving her the most trouble. An American passport of a non-white (yes, that&amp;rsquo;s racist) is much more dangerous in the hands of miscreants, as per the US Embassy. I wished her luck and returned to my work which I did for a while before falling asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;house-of-horrors&#34;&gt;House of Horrors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up in the morning and extended my stay another day. Cambodia has a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/jun/05/trains-phnom-penh-sihanoukville-kampot&#34;&gt;new train service&lt;/a&gt; that I was planning to take. The train ran from Friday to Sunday and I could use the day (being Thursday) to see the Genocide Museum. I asked the hostel owner about the train and he had no idea about it. He had just heard some faint news about a restarting of passenger train services. The service was &lt;strong&gt;THAT&lt;/strong&gt; new! I decided to book a ticket just to be sure. I did not want to miss my chance of experiencing something so novel in the country just because I was lazy. So I walked to the railway station first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8405/28759643823_e8e2331a46.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;pp-buildings&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Contrasting buildings in Phnom Penh&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I passed the Central Market on the way but did not go in. The entrance of the station was a little difficult to find and I, like I am accustomed to do, walked in through the wrong gate. A guard came running and asked me to go back but I had already spotted what looked like a reservation counter and I did not know I was coming from the wrong way. I thought that this might be some kind of trick of theirs which was aimed at discouraging people to use the railway. I had read all kinds of stories online, mostly outdated but you never know. I insisted that I needed to go to the building but he failed to understand me. I, in turn, refused to go back and then he finally pointed at another exit which was closer to the building. Okay, I would take that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8302/29345720246_9fa3060838.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;railway-station-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;The wrong side of railway station&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I approached the reservation building from the correct side this time. It was obvious now that I had been coming from the wrong side but how was I to know! Plus a &amp;ldquo;wrong way&amp;rdquo; into a railway station is something unknown to me. The reservation process itself was pretty simple. I handed 6 USD and was given a hand written ticket that was even less official looking than Myanmar&amp;rsquo;s. But I knew about the recency of the service and just confirmed the date and time before leaving. I walked back to the market and sat in a cafe to kill time till after the lunch hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coffee was expensive but they had WiFi and I needed to work. I sat there for two hours or so and then left for the &lt;strong&gt;S21 Genocide Museum&lt;/strong&gt;. I walked all the way, some 40 minutes or so. The sun was out and it was a little hot. I reached the museum which was bang in the middle of the residential area. I knew very little about this place, just that it used to be a high school that was converted into a torture center. The entrance fee was 3 USD and it was another 3 for the audio tour. I opted for it; this was to be my first audio tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent 3-4 hours in that horror house. The audio tour was very well done, probably a bit too well. I was moved to tears more than once. It was a sad thing that had happened and so unjust! The &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Rouge&#34;&gt;Khmer Rouge&lt;/a&gt; had ousted a supposedly American backed government in Cambodia, the Khmer Republic. Khmer Rouge was socialist in their philosophy and the people welcomed them initially. Then they started ruling by the iron fist that is typical of such forms of government. International communications were cut off and people were forced into the countryside to do agricultural work, something on which the Polpot government had based itself. A series of secret security offices were established across the country. S21 was the biggest of them and it was here that the head of prisons, Duch, operated from. The supposed &amp;ldquo;offenders&amp;rdquo; were brought to S21 to be tortured till they admitted to whatever crimes they were charged with, mostly of being American or Russian spies and for leaking information outside the country. &lt;strong&gt;Angkar&lt;/strong&gt;, the secret police, became a paranoia driven organisation which kept feeding such prisons with people who had no idea what they were being brought in for. There were mass marriages organised in order for women to give birth to babies that Angkar could mould into future workforce. The women were worked immediately before and after delivery, and the babies usually died of malnutrition. There were pictures of prisoners that the security guards could not get rid of in the hurry that they fled. There was anguish in some eyes, horror in others, sadness in others still, shock in some and some showed their resilience by smiling. It was utterly horrifying; an entire generation scarred by the madness of a few. I wondered what &lt;a href=&#34;http://time.com/6997/cambodias-khmer-rouge-trials-are-a-shocking-failure/&#34;&gt;justice&lt;/a&gt; would be in such a case and if there is a justice at all for such situations. If not, then is justice simply an illusion?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Scenes from the Genocide Museum&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The audio tour had many interviews from survivors and there were exhibitions in the museum highlighting certain aspects of the Polpot regime and how it affected the society still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phnom Penh Tip #1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do take the audio tour when you go to the S21 Genocide Museum. You will learn so much more about a history that needs to be remembered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was probably the last tourist to leave the place. I listened to all the stories in the audio guide. I had gone through all the cells and looked at most of the exhibitions. There were a few children playing football with a &lt;em&gt;chinlone&lt;/em&gt; in the complex. I saw it as a representation of how the people were getting over their horrible past. Now it was just a memory for them, something that the world needed to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;A fresh start&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked back to the city and ate some fruits and fried noodles on the way. I spent the rest of the evening in the bed sorting some pictures. The German is a funny guy and it would have been nice to know him better but I was utterly bogged down by my backlog and wanted to get done with it. I watched France defeat Germany in the semifinals and cursed Euro&amp;rsquo;s quality of football once again before going to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;royal-railways&#34;&gt;Royal Railways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up and checked out. The owner joked that he thought I&amp;rsquo;d never leave, but he got quite interested when I told him that I was taking the train. I walked back to the cafe I had sat in the previous day and sat working on my blog. I got up to leave at 2:00 PM and walked the rest of the way till the station. The skies were overclouded but I was hopeful of making it to the station in time. The rains came down when I was just a hundred meters away. I ran the distance but still got a little soaked in the sudden heavy downpour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to wait till 2:30 PM for the boarding to start. The train was a really short one. Just two coaches of which just one was partially full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8308/29271527932_3d4663394c.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;pp-train-3&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Train!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was one of the two foreigners who were taking the train. I settled down on a seat and had it to myself. I stretched out on the seat opposite to mine since that was empty as well. The train started 3 minutes to 3 PM and went a little ahead and turned back on another track to pick a luggage carriage. Then it went ahead again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AC was a Panasonic cooler that was installed over the door and the attendants came in with remotes to adjust temperatures when required. There was WiFi as well though the router gave trouble and it seemed to be simply running on dongles. They were still figuring out stuff but the entire effort that they were putting into the re-instantiation of the passenger rail service was commendable.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Uncrowded&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since the S21 tour I had started seeing Cambodia as a country that was rebuilding itself instead of one that was in shambles. Phnom Penh had it&amp;rsquo;s share of construction going on. There were high rises slowly and steadily making there mark in the city&amp;rsquo;s skyline. They will come of age if the world lets them be. Everything takes care of itself in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had decided to take up the teaching job near Saigon but an expiring visa meant that I needed to exit Vietnam and come back with a new visa. Cambodia was the closest exit and I had a Cambodian visa ready. There are regular buses from Saigon to Phnom Penh and I took one of the many. This was to be my first over-land border crossing and I had little idea what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-night-in-saigon&#34;&gt;A Night in Saigon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stayed up till 4 in the morning to watch Italy lose in the most pathetic penalty shoot out ever! I think people deserve better than that for their time. Anyway, I quickly packed up and checked out of my guest house in Mui Ne. A bit of walking up and down the road helped me find the cheapest price for a bus to &lt;strong&gt;Ho Chi Minh City&lt;/strong&gt;, still aliased as &lt;strong&gt;Saigon&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;HCMC&lt;/strong&gt;. Weirdly the rates are not standard and every tour agent quotes a price of his own. I bought a ticket for 120 kVND, dropped my bags and then went to have some breakfast and kill time till the bus was due.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip #12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you know of a good service and are booking from it&amp;rsquo;s office, it is usually a good idea to ask around to get an idea of the usual rate for tickets. You might be able to save more money than you might have thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bus was a &amp;ldquo;sleeper&amp;rdquo;, in keeping with the standards of Vietnam. I made myself comfortable in my seat and dozed off as usual. By the time I woke up, the bus was rolling into Ho Chi Minh City. The bus made it&amp;rsquo;s way to &lt;strong&gt;District 1&lt;/strong&gt; and stopped at the bus stand there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;instagram-media&#34; data-instgrm-version=&#34;7&#34; style=&#34; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;padding:8px;&#34;&gt; &lt;div style=&#34; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&#34;&gt; &lt;div style=&#34; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&#34; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/p/BHbYDXvhai5/&#34; style=&#34; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;A photo posted by Karan (@grasskode)&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;time style=&#34; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&#34; datetime=&#34;2016-07-04T05:25:40+00:00&#34;&gt;Jul 3, 2016 at 10:25pm PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got off and the first thing I did was to go back to a &lt;strong&gt;Burger King&lt;/strong&gt; I had seen a little distance from the bus stand! I ordered a Double Whopper, my BK favourite, which cost me more than two meals (not by District 1 standards though) but filled me up for the rest of the day. I am not sure whether I liked it though. I was looking for some comfort food and the burger suddenly felt alien and dry midway through. I was surprised at myself for thinking that I would have gladly traded it for a &lt;em&gt;Bun Thit Nuong&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8331/29384016755_8013303a2a.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;saigon-burger-king&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Double Whopper no longer cuts it!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entire area was a travel hub and I walked past many shops advertising buses to Phnom Penh. I was not sure whether I would go the next day or the day after so I just fished around for a good price. The prices varied from 10 - 13 USD. I walked up to my hostel, on the &amp;ldquo;outskirts&amp;rdquo; of District 1, and checked in. The room was something of a suite converted into a dormitory by stuffing bunk beds inside it. It was pretty comfortable though and had a few long term dwellers in it who were interesting in their own sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was Miguel, a Spaniard, who was working as an English teacher in Saigon and liked smoking weed. He had faked his certification to get the job and offered to make a fake certificate for me as well. He had been doing it since high school, as he told me. üëè Then there was Tomas, a freelance consultant for Microsoft Office 360 who incessantly talked about his job and the greatness of the product he was selling. He was Vietnamese and had a thing or two to say about the Vietnamese government and the Americans. These are the topics that I was looking forward to learning about during my month long teaching stint. There was another gentleman who sold some kind of nutrition drink and kept to himself mostly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat a while and then went back to the bus station area to figure out a transportation to Phnom Penh. I walked around and eventually took a 10 dollar bus that had a decent online review - &lt;strong&gt;Phuong Heng&lt;/strong&gt;. Then I wandered about and came upon the famous backpacker street of Saigon, Pham Ngu Lao street. It was right behind the bus station lane. I walked down on a road full of bars and pubs playing loud music, good looking girls dressed in luring clothes inviting you for a drink or a massage, vendors selling everything from sunglasses to drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8152/29383983775_38a0d50e35.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;saigon-backpacker-street&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Pham Ngu Lao street&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this journey this has been a constant source of confusion for me. I had always thought of backpackers as travellers who had strict budgets and were keen to explore. They were, in my opinion, willing to walk the extra mile to find a better bargain. Consequently, they also lived with much more exposure to the local culture than the ones living in resorts or hotels and spending time in utmost luxury. I was coming to realise that either my understanding of the word was wrong or it had come to mean something else altogether. Now-a-days the word &lt;strong&gt;backpacker&lt;/strong&gt; stood for someone :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who was primarily young.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who partied every night.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who spent loads on drugs, alcohol and prostitution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who lived in flashy recommended lodgings; party hostel chains (yes, there exists such a thing!) many a times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who did tours and took package trips with other &amp;ldquo;backpackers&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I have met a handful who were as I had imagined backpackers to be, the majority has been as I described above. With so many definitions floating around, it is difficult to categorise who is what but a backpacker definitely does not mean what I had thought it to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I walked past and out to the main street. I was looking for a cafe to sit and write a bit in but I could not find one of those street side cafes that I had found a profusion of in the other towns. I went into a packed and expensive looking coffee shop never the less. 50k for a Ca Phe Sua Da. The coffee was good though and I sat between loud Vietnamese kids who were enjoying their evening. Saigon seems much more advanced (or westernized) than Hanoi. I liked it though. Such joints do not necessarily mean that they are losing their culture, but rather that they are coming out of their cocoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back to the hostel and got a couple of printouts of the e-visa. Some nationalities are able to get visa on arrival at the Cambodian border but Indians, as can be guessed, cannot avail that facility. We need our visas beforehand and the easiest way to do it is the Cambodian &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.evisa.gov.kh/&#34;&gt;e-visa&lt;/a&gt;. It costs you 40 USD (37 for the visa and 3 for processing fee) and is usually in your mail box a couple of days after applying. The entire process is hassle free and quite simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cambodia Tip #1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If going to Cambodia, avail their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.evisa.gov.kh/&#34;&gt;e-visa&lt;/a&gt; facility. It is extremely simple and hassle free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a bath and then went to bed after an irritating conversation with a fellow dorm-mate. He was an old Thai man who was obsessed with monkeys and wanted to know if everyone shat and pissed on the streets in India. I laughed him off, probably because I did not want to acknowledge the shameful reality from recent past. I told him, and hoped inwardly, that things were getting better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;crossing-borders&#34;&gt;Crossing Borders&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up and checked out of the hotel. The bus was at 1 PM and I had enough time to go looking for some food. I walked to the other side of the bus stand, following up on some vague online recommendations for local specialties. I could not find any of the specialties but settled for a plate of &lt;em&gt;Com Tam&lt;/em&gt; before heading back to the Phuong Heng office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saigon Tip #1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;District One is costly. &lt;strong&gt;VERY&lt;/strong&gt; costly. A meal will typically cost you 2-3 times of what it costs elsewhere in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it was time, a guy walked us to the bus which stood waiting in the bus station. The seats looked comfortable and I tried sleeping as the bus moved out of Saigon. However, I had trouble falling sleeping. I guess I am not very comfortable in spacious seats. I find it easier to crawl into a corner and doze off rather than tumble about in a huge seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bus stopped a couple of hours after departing Saigon. We were at the &lt;strong&gt;Bavet border crossing&lt;/strong&gt;. First up was the Vietnamese checkpoint. The conductor had come around earlier to collect our passports. I had an e-visa but the ones that wanted to get a visa on arrival had to cough up 35 USD. The conductor, in turn, took care of the entire procedure, which, though not much, saved some time. He took the passports and handed the over to the immigration officer inside the building. We had to take our bags and put them through a scanner and then wait till our passport was processed. Then walked up to the counter, collected the passport, got it checked for the stamp by the guard at the gate and sat inside the bus that was waiting for us. The entire process takes less than 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8286/28762554353_f681195bca.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;border-vietnam-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Getting stamped out of Vietnam&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once everyone was back, the bus moved a couple of hundred meters to the Cambodian checkpoint. Here we got off again and handed our passports to an official who glanced at our faces to fleetingly compare it with the passport&amp;rsquo;s photograph. We were made to enter and walk out of a building since the conductor was taking care of the visas. This was something of a formality and there were no scans or checks done. The bus was waiting for us at the exit gate and we got into it. There were a few people selling Cambodia currency and mobile SIM cards which I avoided due to uncertainty of their authenticity. Once everyone, except the conductor, was in, the bus started again and made it&amp;rsquo;s way into Cambodia. Casinos, big and small, lined the highway on either sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7541/28759875894_1a5ee6a83a.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;border-cambodia-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Casinos on the Cambodian side&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anxious passengers started questioning the driver as to the missing passports and he told them to wait. We stopped in a couple of kilometers at an eatery. The food was over-priced and you could use your leftover dongs to pay for the meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cambodia Tip #2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it is strange to leave your passport in the hands of a bus assistant but the Bavet border crossing has a rather streamlined process and you should generally not worry about the passports. You wait at an eatery while the conductor gets the passport processed at the checkpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got talking to the two Israelis on the bus while we had lunch. They were Eitan and Daniel and they were not doing India unlike most of the Israelis. I suppose they fancied the unusual as well. They had completed their military service and were travelling before joining school. We ate, paid our bills and sat in the bus. The assistant was back and came around distributing the passports. We had managed to enter Cambodia without any check of any sort. Neither had we been verified against our passports nor had our luggage been scanned for what we were carrying. Eitan called this lazy rather than convenient. I could not agree more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8555/28759841474_c3b344ccff.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;border-cambodia-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Stamped into Cambodia without a check üéâ&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made our way into Cambodia. The first difference, as Daniel had pointed out, was that Cambodian men can grow facial hair, unlike their Vietnamese counterparts. üòÖ The most obvious contrast was, however, Cambodia&amp;rsquo;s poverty. The infrastructure was in a ramshackle state. However, the highway was good enough and we headed to Phnom Penh with some speed. We stopped once more at a highway mart to use the toilets and buy some snacks. It started raining and the traffic held us up just as we entered Phnom Penh but we made it to the stop soon after, within the 6 hours that the company had promised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another obvious difference was that the Cambodian &lt;em&gt;tuk-tuk&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;motodop&lt;/em&gt; drivers were better with their English and much more irritating and persistent than the Vietnamese ones. Daniel, Eitan and I set out to search for hostels. The &lt;em&gt;tuk-tuks&lt;/em&gt; were offering to take us to the hostel area for 2 USD but we decided to walk instead. These guys liked to do it in the old fashioned way; no GPS, just a Lonely Planet guidebook and a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;maps.me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; app. I did not find it the most efficient of ways but since I did not have network myself, I went along. We wandered in the lanes and found some guest houses offering rooms for the night or shorter periods (3-4 hours). Phnom Penh&amp;rsquo;s shadier side was just getting started. It started drizzling and the guys got themselves a double room in one of the LP recommendations. It was too costly for me as a solo traveller, so I decided to get a dorm. A short lived WiFi connection told me which direction to walk in. The street lights were not always working and the city seemed to be way too underpopulated for a capital. Things seem much more shadier than they had been in the neighbouring two countries (Thailand and Vietnam). There was garbage strewn all over the roads and the roads were downright filthy in places. The pavement was mostly broken or dug up or doubled up as parking space. A lot of this reminded me of the India I had seen while growing up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked 30 minutes in the dark and drizzle to get to &lt;strong&gt;Velcommen Backpackers&lt;/strong&gt; by the riverside. Here I was over-quoted the price once again and when I told them that I would rather book through agoda, they brought down the rate to match the listed price. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why this is so but I do not like it for sure. Do not list your place on agoda if it is economically infeasible, but stop varying your rates so! I went to the dorm room and dropped my bags. There were a few English kids sitting around. I climbed up the wobbly dorm bed and sat a while to cool down. Then I took a shower and headed out to search for some food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EVERY&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;tuk-tuk&lt;/em&gt; and moto driver in Phnom Penh calls out to you. And there are quite a few of them. If three of them are standing together, all three will take a shot at you one by one. It gets on your nerves after a while. I had to relearn how to rudely ignore them after the first few nays. I found an eatery a short walk away that served food and Cambodia&amp;rsquo;s favourite beverage - beer. Had a plate of &lt;strong&gt;Lok Lak&lt;/strong&gt; and a glass of Anchor beer to fill me up for the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Beef Lok Lak&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prices are in dollars so that makes things a bit expensive. I had thought that Cambodia, being poorer than Vietnam, would be cheaper than Vietnam. This was definitely not the case. Though it was not breaking my bank, Cambodia was proving to be much more expensive than I had thought it would be. The Cambodian &lt;strong&gt;riel&lt;/strong&gt; is something of a change currency and most of the transactions are made in dollars. Even the ATMs out here dispense USDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cambodia Tip #3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not exchange currency while travelling to Cambodia. Get USDs from wherever you are starting and use them in Cambodia. If you run out of cash, the ATMs in the country dispense USDs as well which is convenient to carry the leftover cash. The Cambodia riel is simply a change currency and will not be accepted (even for exchange) anywhere outside Cambodia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a series of buses from H·ªôi An to reach ƒê√† L·∫°t, a hill station known for it&amp;rsquo;s eternal spring weather. I was looking forward to this leg of my journey to get a respite from all the heat and humidity of the northern half of Vietnam. What I found was a city full of beautiful flowers and bewitching architecture, unexpectedly cold weather and warm people, oodles of hill station charms and an amazing blend of foreign and local tourists. Falling in love with this city was effortless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sweater-weather&#34;&gt;Sweater Weather&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bus reached Nha Trang early in the morning, around 5 AM. The connecting bus to ƒê√† L·∫°t was at 7 AM so I dumped my bags in the office and rushed to the beach that was just two lanes away. It was still dawn and I hoped to catch a nice sunrise on an empty beach. Turned out, the entire city was to be found at the beach! There were people walking, jogging, doing aerobics and what not! The sea was also full of people enjoying a dip at this hour. I mean, who swims this early in the morning?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;instagram-media&#34; data-instgrm-version=&#34;7&#34; style=&#34; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;padding:8px;&#34;&gt; &lt;div style=&#34; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&#34;&gt; &lt;div style=&#34; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&#34; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/p/BHLToMsBysL/&#34; style=&#34; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;A photo posted by Karan (@grasskode)&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;time style=&#34; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&#34; datetime=&#34;2016-06-27T23:39:10+00:00&#34;&gt;Jun 27, 2016 at 4:39pm PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could not see the sun because of the clouds and gave up the task because I was getting hungry. I went around the block and ate a bowl of Pho. All the sign boards and shop names here were in Vietnamese, Russian and at times English. üòã The Russian presence always makes itself felt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back to the Sinh Tourist office and waited a while for the bus to turn up. This one was a sleeper as well and I actually got some much needed sleep on this one, though I missed out on quite a lot of scenery. I kept waking intermittently to find the world around me changing. The plains gave way to hilly contours; the road was wavy and flanked by greenery; the rains imparted a cosy touch to it all. We reached ƒê√† L·∫°t in a couple of hours since having started from Nha Trang. The city looked very pretty and we made our way to the bus company&amp;rsquo;s office. There was one small trouble though; it was raining continuously. I stood under a shelter at the office trying to figure out where I would stay. I had not booked a hostel thinking that I could walk around to find a place, but the rains were playing a spoilsport and I needed some more rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the rain let up a bit, I walked in a certain direction that seemed to have a few good hostels. The rains resumed shortly and I took out my poncho. I came upon the &lt;strong&gt;YOLO hostel&lt;/strong&gt; first and went in. They had a dorm bed available in a huge hall with mattresses laid out on the wooden floor. I liked the setup somewhat but they gave me the room for a price of the smaller dorm and some haggling around the agoda price. I decided to stay here just for the night. I kept my bags and worked a bit while I waited for the rains to ease. Then I went out to get something to eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was uncomfortably cold outside. I was not prepared for such a weather, neither mentally nor with my wardrobe. I would have to buy a sweater, but first, I had to eat! I crossed a small cafe near the hostel and took a look at their menu. The lady who ran the place pulled me in and I ordered a &lt;em&gt;Bun Cha&lt;/em&gt; at her suggestion. This lady was something of an eccentric character. She told me that the Bun Cha here was very different from Hanoi&amp;rsquo;s. Then she went to cook a fresh plate which took a while and once she came back with the food, she showed me several pictures of the food she had prepared throughout the day. üòù The Bun Cha was somewhat different from Hanoi&amp;rsquo;s but I could feel certain similarities. In any case, my craving for the delicious dish simply refueled rather than being satiated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8252/29070217985_e505575ffc.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tu-anh-peace-restaurant&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Bun Cha (not quite) Hanoi&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked further after having filled my stomach a bit. An &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.travelfish.org/sight_profile/vietnam/central_highlands/lam_dong/da_lat/605&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easy Rider&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; fellow caught hold of me while I was walking about. I had heard so much about this service that I was curious enough to ask him what it was all about. He explained the concept to me. It is basically a motorbike tour to places in and around ƒê√† L·∫°t. The customer rides pillion with the rider and the prices seemed to be pretty reasonable for the duration and the services offered. However, I was not much of a pillion rider, so I just thanked him for the information and went into another eatery that looked more local. I thought I ordered a &lt;em&gt;Bun Cha&lt;/em&gt; here as well, hoping to savour a more local taste of the same dish. But silly me did not know that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bun Cha Ca&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was much different from &lt;em&gt;Bun Cha&lt;/em&gt;. üòë And so it was that I found another way that the Vietnamese do the noodle soup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8449/29070217225_abef28ec03.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bun-cha-ca&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Bun Cha Ca&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked around the roads after this, trying to trace a big circle back to the hostel. I think all the hill stations have similarly haphazard roads. There is very little planning that can be done in the mountainous terrain. I saw a peaceful Buddhist temple and a church. Then I walked around the roads lined with shops searching for a sweater to save myself from the chilling winds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8455/29037379266_6759c876eb.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;chua-linh-son-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Chua Linh Son&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw a shop that was selling sweatshirts for 100 kVND and went to check it out. The designs were not bad and the bargain seemed well worth it but I did not get any, deciding in favour of checking more options. I walked up to the main market. Right before the market building, there people selling clothes on the street; &lt;em&gt;Janpath&lt;/em&gt; style! üòÜ I witnessed a scene where a police van&amp;rsquo;s approach sent everyone scuttling away and then they slowly resumed sales when the van went out of sight. I browsed through some jackets here as well. Not the best of quality but, once again, cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8025/28452401583_a75d5aea6d.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ƒê√† L·∫°t-market-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;A stall at the market&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went into the market building and walked through it. There were better shops inside but I knew I was looking for a cheaper option. I went out the other side of the market building. There were lots of shops selling various items of daily need, dried food, fresh meals, flowers and plants, vegetables, tarts, jams and what not. I finally found a decent jacket worth 100 kVND in one of the street-side places. It was a flimsy thing, something of a stylish windcheater. I put it on and it did the job of keeping me warm. I ate a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;B√°nh Tr√°ng N∆∞·ªõng&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on my way out. This was the famous Vietnamese pizza, a local specialty, which was somewhat like an egg roll. It was good but not really a cheap snack that I had supposed it would be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;B√°nh Tr√°ng N∆∞·ªõng - The Vietnamese Pizza&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked back to the hostel which was nearby and spent the rest of the evening indoors. It was raining outside and the blanket felt really cosy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ƒë√†-l·∫°t-on-foot&#34;&gt;ƒê√† L·∫°t on Foot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up the next day and took a much needed bath before checking out. I had booked a cheaper room in another hostel that was a 15 minute walk away. I saw a place advertising &lt;strong&gt;Bun Cha Hanoi&lt;/strong&gt; on the way and obviously felt compelled to stop for a bite. üòÖ I am such a sucker for that dish! But there is no &lt;em&gt;Bun Cha&lt;/em&gt; to be had that is as good as Hanoi&amp;rsquo;s. This one came pretty close but was not quite the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vietnam Tip #8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eat as much &lt;strong&gt;Bun Cha&lt;/strong&gt; as you can when you are in Hanoi! Trust me, it is the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new hostel was much better than the last one. The lanes that led up to the place had the typical touch of the alleys of a small hill town. I really loved the quiet location and the friendly staff. I was invited for lunch with them and their family and friends. I met two girls from Saigon, Mandy and Cindy, and talked to them a bit. I had little to eat because I was already somewhat full with the recent breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went out walking after the lunch and all through, I thought of how wonderful the hill towns were. There was so much love in the air here. One found couples walking hand in hand and it seemed so much in keeping with the mood of the place. It seemed as natural to the hills as is a man rushing about in a city. I encountered a short spell of rains and spent the time sitting in a cafe drinking some amazing coffee and writing. I resumed walking when the rains stopped and went till the &lt;strong&gt;Xuan Huong Lake&lt;/strong&gt;. It is quite a big lake and I walked around it clicking pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8029/28448996254_0f180da307.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;xuan-huong-lake-5&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Xuan Huong Lake&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turned into a park and walked through it to a palace which is now used as a guest house. ƒê√† L·∫°t has some beautiful houses which were turned into hotels or restaurants. The architecture is charming and compliments the scenery really well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Beautiful parks and buildings&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw more beautiful buildings and pretty flowers all the way till the Summer Palace, where I was headed to. The city was mesmerising and vast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought a 15 kVND ticket to the &lt;strong&gt;Summer Palace of Bao Dai&lt;/strong&gt;. This was the kind of ticket fee that makes me a happy tourist. The palace was really nice. It was more of an open house with everything preserved the way it used to be when the royal family lived here; the bedrooms with their beds made up; the halls and sitting rooms with beautiful decor; the well maintained gardens. There was not much history to it but the house is pretty enough to contemplate the lives of it&amp;rsquo;s erstwhile residents. I walked around for a good long hour without getting bored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many more pictures of Bao Dai&amp;rsquo;s Summer Palace in the album at the end of the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked back to the hostel after seeing the palace. It was getting dark and I was somewhat tired from all the walking. I had planned to see the Crazy House but left it for another day. As I was crossing the main market, an older man called out to me and waved hello. Then he shouted something which I did not hear properly so he asked me to stop and made his way to me. I was expecting a sales pitch, perhaps another offer for an Easy Rider tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hello! Where are you from?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; he said with a smile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;India. ·∫§n ƒê·ªô.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; I replied&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh! You speak Vietnamese?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;No no&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; I laughed. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Very little.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Okay. You a movie star?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;What? No!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;You very handsome. Haha!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; he laughed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I laughed in return and thanked him. I was expecting the sales pitch next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Okay then, bye.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoa! I asked him his name. Mr. Bean. üòÇ I walked away amused. You gotta love the hills! I ate some Japanese snacks, Takoyaki, from a street side cart and drank some cold milk tea with jellies, Tra Sua. Then I returned to the hostel to rest and write a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went down to the common room later in the night. Everyone was jamming to some Vietnamese and English songs. I tried playing the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caj%C3%B3n&#34;&gt;caj√≥n&lt;/a&gt; there but it was a little difficult as I did not know how those Vietnamese songs would progress. Mandy and Cindy were there and two Dutch siblings also came in, Rose and William. Rose had been interning at a nearby coffee plantation for the last 3 months and had recently finished. William had just joined her and they were planning to travel through Vietnam for a while before returning home. I enjoyed a couple of beers with everyone and then headed to the room to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;scootering-around&#34;&gt;Scootering Around&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rooster had been cock-a-doodling in the middle of the night. I had a tough time falling asleep and then I woke up to find everyone around me up and about. I thought it would be late in the morning but it was just 6:30 AM! I cursed under my breath and tried to sleep some more. I woke up again at 7:45 AM and found the room empty. I suspected that the mobile&amp;rsquo;s clock was off and checked my red watch which I had not been using for a while. It said 10:45! I had planned on going to Pongour waterfalls with the Dutch at 10 AM today. They might have left already and I needed to get going as well. So I got out of the bed and brushed my teeth. While I did my toilet, I realised that I had seen the stopwatch on the red watch which had been running for almost 11 hours for some reason. The time was still less than 8 AM in the morning. But there was no returning to sleep from this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went down around 9:30 AM and was given a coupon for free breakfast, something that I had not known about! The breakfast was in the hostel next door and the lady here, a good natured woman whom we called Mama, gave me a few options. I chose the bread, butter and jam with coffee. There were three more people at the table. An English-Canadian couple who were working in Dubai and a American woman who lived in Hawaii. I started talking to the American when she asked me &amp;ldquo;Hablas Espanyol?&amp;rdquo; No I did not, but I felt that this was the comparison that made the most sense. She had been to India and it was her favourite place. She was a &amp;ldquo;yogini&amp;rdquo; and a vegetarian which might be a reason for her profound love for India. I can see how our country is such a paradise for vegetarians. She asked me if I did yoga and I had to tell her that not every Indian did yoga and that the &amp;ldquo;world famous&amp;rdquo; yoga gurus were not so famous within the country. She expressed surprise as to how we could have given the world something so amazing and forgotten about it ourselves. I told her that our materialistic pursuits were far more important at the moment, but hopefully things would change soon. Anyway, I helped her plan her itinerary for her northward journey through Vietnam while we had breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rented a scooter from the hostel and joined the Dutch for Pongour Waterfalls. There are a few waterfalls around ƒê√† L·∫°t and Pongour is the one farthest away and considered the more beautiful by some. The English-Canadian couple also joined us and we set out across the city. The English woman was riding their scooter and was having a little trouble coping with the Vietnamese traffic. But she was coping well and learning fast! We went slow and steady in order to stay together. The highway after the city was not much of a ride because a long part of it was under repair. There was a lot of dust and rowdy trucks that did not help the case. We finally left the highway for a more beautiful road that went through picturesque fields and led us to the waterfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Beautiful road to the waterfalls&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We bought the entry and parking tickets and walked the rest of the way after leaving the bikes in the parking lot. A few Easy Riders had also come in with their customers. Contrary to the jungle trail I had been expecting, it turned out to be a paved pathway all the way to the falls. There were a few small shops and eateries just before the falls. A barbed wire fencing around the pool and sign boards warned the visitors against getting into the water. I do not like such controlled places. How difficult is it to let nature be? This being the condition of the least touristy falls, I did not really want to go see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Warning Sign&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The falls themselves were beautiful though. The water cascaded down in steps and was pleasantly cold. Everyone was clicking pictures of the falls and themselves. I jumped about the rocks and decided to ignore the board asking people not to climb and went one level up into the falls. The view was even more beautiful from here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Pongour Waterfalls&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dubai couple left a little earlier than the rest of us. The Dutch and I left at the same time but they were going back to ƒê√† L·∫°t and I planned to take an alternate route to the north-west of the town (we were south of ƒê√† L·∫°t right now) before heading back to the hostel. Probably the most interesting part of this outing was talking to William. He had read a lot about India and wanted to go there. He said found India interesting. How so, I asked? He said it was because of the cultures, religions, how they treated their women, history, etc. I told him that what made India really interesting was how all those things were never the same but varied as per the given place, time and socio-economic class. He wanted to know about nature in India. I told him I found it much better than here. He was impressed by these falls so I guess it was much better than his part of Europe as well. Anyway, we said goodbye at the parking lot and I took the alternate route back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turned into a dirt track soon after leaving the falls. The dirt had turned into mud in the patches where the rain water had accumulated. The entire route went through such tracks and tarred roads of varying qualities. It also provided views to amazing countryside and rural sceneries. The locals were amused to see a foreigner on the off-road and smiled at me when I caught their curious stares. I went off track once when I followed the road, mesmerised by the beautiful buildings in the village, instead of turning into yet another dirt trail. But it was all an amazing and beautiful experience. I stopped at a random place to eat some &lt;em&gt;Com Binh Dan&lt;/em&gt; and it was here that I first had the amazing beef cutlet - &lt;strong&gt;Bo La Lot&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second half of the journey had better roads. I was passing by ƒê√† L·∫°t which lay on my east. The hills began soon enough and I hit upon patches full of greenhouses. Out here there was barely any ground to be seen on the slopes of the hills; there was the translucent white roof of the greenhouses that covered the entire landscape at times. At places, the hills were marked with the reddish muddy scars of where they had been cut out to make farms. It was interesting how these hills had been modified to suit the human need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My destination had been a certain spot marked on the map as Golden Valley. I got to the entry and paid 40 kVND for the ticket. I rode on to the parking and continued thereafter on foot. There were a lot of tourists here, mostly Vietnamese. There was a path leading up into the hills which I took first. The only term I have to describe the entire setup is : a big park. The hill had been turned into a big garden like setup with a flowing stream, wooden bridges, horses and costumes to get oneself pictures clicked with, flowers, shed, broken carts and many more beautifications of the vein! I walked to the top of the hill expecting to see something here but there was just a trickling pipe which was labelled as a &amp;ldquo;waterfall&amp;rdquo;. üòí The lake was on the other side so I worked my way back down and headed towards it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8517/28783816690_0eca74c370.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;golden-valley-4&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Hill Garden&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The area around the lake was also heavily decorated. Flowery gardens, paddle boats, suspension bamboo bridge, pretty walkways and cafes. I personally do not like such made up nature but I could see the value in this. ƒê√† L·∫°t was catering to a particular industry of local tourists, mostly couples and families. This is that intrigued them and I could see all of them happily spending time all over the place, clicking photos and enjoying their walks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Tourist attraction&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I was here, I thought I might just as well make the most of it. I went and sat in a bamboo shelter at the edge of the lake. I guessed that the &amp;ldquo;golden&amp;rdquo; in the name of the valley came because of the muddy waters of the lake. I rested a bit and observed the tourists all around. I also clicked some photos, trying as many angles as I could without leaving my spot. üòú I headed back towards ƒê√† L·∫°t when the sun was about to set behind the hills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city was close enough and I reached the hostel before it got dark. I returned the scooter and went out to eat. A particular place caught my nose with it&amp;rsquo;s amazing smell of barbecue and I went in. I had barbecued pork with rice, a simple and delicious meal. I was sharing the table with a young girl who showed me how to clean the cup and poured me some tea after the food. I thanked her and she kept giggling in reply. üòÑ Kids!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also had a couple of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hot Dogs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; after dinner. This dish is not actually a hot dog but simply a toasted cake with cheese or chocolate inside. Since I had not had either cheese or chocolate in a while, I got one of each and munched on them on my way back to the hostel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;A different kind of Hot Dog&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guys were jamming and singing as usual in the common room and I sat with a beer. Some of them were planning to go to a bar nearby and I initially thought I would join them but later decided against it because I was too tired after the long day. I hit the bed a little later but stayed up to watch the Portugal vs Poland match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ƒë√†-l·∫°t-nights&#34;&gt;ƒê√† L·∫°t Nights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had slept late because the match had gone into penalty shootouts. Then I woke up early again because everyone in my room was up and about. I did not get why everyone woke up so early every day! I struggled to sleep and eventually got out of bed &amp;ldquo;late&amp;rdquo; at 10 AM. I got some breakfast and moved to another hostel. I wanted to extend my stay by a day and the manager informed me that they were completely booked. She shifted me to a nearby hostel which was not too bad. There were just 4 beds per dorm and I was the only one in my room when I got there. I decided to head out to the supermarket near the lake after dumping my bags. I needed some basic ration and wanted to check out the peculiar looking place as well. My walk to the C-Mart went without much event; just a drunk man offering me some rice wine in the middle of the afternoon which I had to decline with emphasis. The supermarket was built entirely underground and the area above had been converted into a quirky looking public square. I took some pictures and then went in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went about the supermarket getting more things than I had initially planned to get. There were a couple of things that I wanted to take back to India which I got got here. I am a sucker for supermarkets anyway. I sat in the food court eating a &lt;strong&gt;Hu Tieu&lt;/strong&gt; and trying to stuff my shopping into my tiny bag. I managed it somehow and then headed back to the hostel to drop off my purchases. I had a roommate by the time I got there; a young boy from HCM. We exchanged hellos and I tried taking a bath in the broken down bathroom with a door that would not lock. I went out to a good cafe nearby to sit and drink some coffee and work a little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8402/28449022414_61a157a3ed.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;cafe-3&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Work and Coffee (please don&#39;t judge the Windows 10)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back to Mama&amp;rsquo;s in time for some &amp;ldquo;family dinner&amp;rdquo; that I had been invited to. Everyone had already gathered by the time I reached. There were the Dutch and the couple from &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guernsey&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guernsey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It was amazing how I was coming to know about so many new nations. I had no idea about &lt;strong&gt;Channel Islands&lt;/strong&gt; before today. The food was quite delicious and I ate a couple of bowls of rice before calling it quits. The Dutch told me that they had gone to the cable car today and I told them that I had done nothing worthwhile all day. üòé After dinner, I went back to the room to work some more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to Note Hostel around 9 PM. I grabbed a beer and talked to some young folks from the provinces around ƒê√† L·∫°t who were on vacation here. They were trying to speak to me in their limited English and I was trying my best to understand and reply. There was the jamming and karaoke again. I liked the energy and enthusiasm. The Dutch were asked to sing a few songs first and then it was my turn. The guitarist and I did Lucky Ali&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;O Sanam&amp;rdquo;. I somehow managed to pull it off with my laughable vocal skills. üòÅ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few of us decided to go to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g293922-d6948253-Reviews-100_Roofs_Cafe-Da_Lat_Lam_Dong_Province.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maze Bar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(or 100 Roofs Bar). We took a cab while we could have easily walked the distance, but the cab was cheap enough. This bar is one of the major tourist attractions of ƒê√† L·∫°t and not without reason. It is really amazing. There are staircases going everywhere and the entire building is made like a maze. The pain and effort put into making the place is extremely evident. We grabbed a few drinks and sat in one of the corners to enjoy them. I got talking to the guy from Liverpool, Alex, who had come in earlier that afternoon. He used to be a mechanical engineer and had quit his job when he started travelling. He had been on the road for quite a while now. I also came to know that William and Rose were not twins as I had previously thought. Rose was just 20 and William was 5 years older to her. We finished our drinks while trying to guess the number of people in the bar at that moment. It was a difficult task because there was not a single seating area and we agreed on a number between 150 and 200.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;The Maze Bar&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went to another pub after this one. Linh, the Vietnamese staff from Note Hostel who was accompanying us, took a cab again while this was actually just a 5 minute walk! None other than Rose minded a lot though. There was live music here and it sounded a bit too loud to me initially. The drummer was high but extremely good. I eventually got myself a beer and we all enjoyed the band till it was time to close at midnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Nightcrawlers&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We headed back to the hostel and made Linh walk the 600 meters despite his laziness. We talked about our favourite Vietnamese food on the way and said goodbye in front of the hostel. I went to mine and sat watching Wales crush Belgium in the Euro cup. This was one of the better matches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;unexpected-opportunity&#34;&gt;Unexpected Opportunity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had slept better today and woke up much more refreshed. There had been no cock-a-doodling in the middle of the night and no girls making a ruckus early in the morning. The young man from Saigon asked me if I wanted to join him for breakfast and sightseeing for the day. Unfortunately I was going to get the free breakfast and then planning to head out of ƒê√† L·∫°t that day. It would have been interesting to walk around the town with him though. I went to get the breakfast and also booked a ticket to M≈©i N√©. Rose had suggested that I go to Vung Tau but there was no direct transportation from ƒê√† L·∫°t. I would have to break my journey in M≈©i N√© and get another bus from there. I went to the market to withdraw some money from the ATMs and it is a very disturbing task at times. I tried an Eximbank ATM that did not work; then an Agribank did not work; and then a Vietcom refused transaction. The messages are so cryptic that it leaves you wondering whether the problem is with the bank or your card. Eventually the next Agribank worked and I sighed with relief. Then I walked hastily back to the hostel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dutch were also leaving that day. They were making their way northward. Everyone in the hostel killed some time taking photos. Then I checked out of the hostel and sat outside talking to everyone and waiting for the pickup for my bus. The Dutch left first and then Mandy handed me some pamphlets for an English Center that was looking to recruit foreign teachers. She was a manager in one of the centers. I asked her if I could apply. She told me that they preferred native English speakers or ones with some kind of certification but since she knew I had decent command over English, I had a chance. They required a minimum commitment of a month. I told her I would think about it and left it at that for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about it was all I did for the rest of the day. A guy came to pick me up on his motorbike when it was time for the bus. I forgot my jacket right outside the bus when I kept it on a scooter while handing out the ticket. I slept and discussed the offer out with Parul. This would mean serious alterations in my travel plans but it was something that was different from what I did and definitely excited me. I reasoned it as a new experience; I was doing this entire trip for the experiences, then why shut myself to this one just because I had made some travel plans? The bus stopped briefly at a small place for some overpriced food. I slept the rest of the way till M≈©i N√©. When the bus dropped me, I had made my mind to take up Mandy&amp;rsquo;s offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat near the bus service office to look for some viable lodging options nearby. The last bus to Vung Tau had already departed and I would have to stay in the town for the night. The options with better online ratings were seemingly fully booked. There was just one other girl at the office at this time. She was searching for a particular place where her friend was working. She told me that it was a really beautiful hostel right by the beach and they had dorms for 4 USD. I helped her out by offering my phone for her to talk to her friend. It was only after I had agreed that I found out that the place was 20 kms from the town and it would make no sense for me to go that far in the evening just to return early next morning. The girl was Athena, a Canadian with Asian genetics. She had sold her stuff back in Canada and planned to go live with her ex-roommate in Costa Rica, grow and sell weed there and then use the money to travel around. They could even marry so that he could work in Canada. I don&amp;rsquo;t know whether she will be able to do as she plans but that&amp;rsquo;s an interesting take on life. She had had a rough week with stuff getting stolen. She had also managed to leave her wallet on the bus and I sat talking to her while the bus returned with it. Then she went to withdraw some money and I decided to check out some cheap dorm options nearby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked into one that was advertising beds for 5 dollars. It turned out to be the same double room on a sharing basis setup. My roommate this time was an English guy from near Manchester. His name was Robert and he was doing south to north on a motorbike. I talked to him for a bit and then took a bath before heading out for some dinner and to enquire for rates to Vung Tau. This town had more Russian signs and the same pestering motobike drivers with their weed peddling offers. I was glad to be staying just a night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8146/28449013414_10c4efb995.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;mui-ne-board&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;The Russian Town&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also expecting there to be a sandy beach out here but there was just a concrete embankment and lots of sea food shops next to the sea. These seemed to be extremely popular with the local tourists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat in a cafe next to the hostel and troubled the tripping owner to make me a Ca Phe Sua Da. I chatted back home and did some writing before heading back to the room. Robert and his friends were smoking up outside. Mandy had replied to my message and I finalised a few things with her. My month long visa was about to expire so I needed to do a visa run before joining her center. The thing was that they wanted me to join as soon as possible, so I decided that I would head out straight to Cambodia and come back in a couple of weeks. I could always do Vung Tau and remaining southern Vietnam later. That settled, I got myself a bottle of beer and sat watching a boring Italy-Germany tactical match.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>

&lt;p&gt;It seems like I had been planning a solo backpacking trip overseas for ages. In late May 2016, I finally took off for a trip through South East Asia like I had always wanted to. I was dismissive of all deterring arguments. I cared not what was happening to me or around me. This trip was all that mattered right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a tourist bus from Hu·∫ø to H·ªôi An, the charming tourist town a little south of Da Nang. H·ªôi An had come heavily recommended by everyone who had been to Vietnam. I usually approach such tourist towns with a speculative heart but the many reasons of H·ªôi An&amp;rsquo;s popularity would become evident to me over the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;charming-h·ªôi-an&#34;&gt;Charming H·ªôi An&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I forgot my hat in the bus when I got off at H·ªôi An. üòï This, I would remember only later in the night, though. I had not booked a place in H·ªôi An because most of the online listings were somewhat expensive. I thought I would figure it out somehow when I got to H·ªôi An. As I sat putting on my shoes at the bus stand (they make you take off your shoes in the buses), a nice woman walked up to me and offered me a room for 10 USD per night. I told her it was out of my budget and we finally settled at 6 USD a night for a &amp;ldquo;dorm room&amp;rdquo;. I rode with the woman and her little daughter on her bike to the home stay, &lt;a href=&#34;https://goo.gl/maps/S8fwBtkAXw92&#34;&gt;Gom Do&lt;/a&gt;, which was near by. She was amused to learn that I was from India. She said she was told she looked somewhat Indian, which she did; her name was Yum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guest house was nice but the room was not really a &amp;ldquo;dorm room&amp;rdquo;. It was basically a family room with three beds that they were renting out on a sharing basis. Worked for me. I was the first one in the room. There was also a catalogue for tours that I did not intend to take. After I had settled down and was preparing to go out to explore the city, they brought in another taveller. This was Lisa, a European who lived in Argentina and was somewhat surprised at finding the &amp;ldquo;dorm room&amp;rdquo; not quite as she had expected. She was somewhat uncomfortable with the arrangement and took some time to think through the idea. Since I was leaving, we just decided on the beds, protocol for leaving the keys, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a lift from one of the guest house staff on the way to the old town. I asked him to drop me at a nice place to eat and he left me at a street-side place that served &lt;strong&gt;M√¨ Qu·∫£ng&lt;/strong&gt;, a H·ªôi An specialty. It was pretty nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8728/28301512453_842715ea65.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;mi-quang&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;H·ªôi An food tour begins with a M√¨ Qu·∫£ng&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked to the old town that was up ahead. The sun had set and the lights had come up. There were the famous tailor shops everywhere. H·ªôi An&amp;rsquo;s specialty was very evident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8471/28299214514_899a6a41ae.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tailor-shop-3&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Clothes everywhere!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ancient city was lively with lots of lights and tourists. There were Chinese lanterns hanging all around and they looked beautiful in the narrow lanes with old buildings. There were a lot of cafes and restaurants and shops selling all kinds of interesting things like coffee, posters, coasters, souvenirs, etc. The ancient city has some kind of a ticket for entry which covers most of the temples and other sights in the area. I did not know about it so I just walked in. There was no one checking the ticket, in fact it would have been quite a task with so many tourists! I don&amp;rsquo;t think there is a point of taking the ticket at all unless you want to look at the temples and all the buildings with classic architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8722/28301506733_aa0dc52ac7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ancient-town-3&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Charming ancient city&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I crossed the river on a crowded and lit up bridge. The other side had a street market and drinking holes as well. I was handed a flier for a free drink at a Monkey Bar. It was not very happening when I crossed it so I did not go in. There were many more bars and pubs, all of which were just beginning to see business for the night. I was not in the mood for a drink anyway so I contented myself with walking along the river. The whole place was really lively. There were people playing games and some Vietnamese street performances. There were vendors selling food items and souvenirs. Lots of beautiful Chinese lanterns as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked across the small island and sat along the Thu B·ªìn river on the other side. This place was quieter and I got a Ca Phe Sua Da while I wrote a little in my notebook. Eventually I started walking back. The market was still in full swing and everyone was enjoying their night. I saw the famous Japanese Bridge on the way; it was overflowing with selfie clicking tourists but pretty nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;VIDEO : H·ªôi An nights&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply walking around is the thing to do in this town. I did that for a while but I was somewhat tired tonight, so I returned to the room and called it an early night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-bang-beach&#34;&gt;An Bang Beach&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up and had a simple breakfast at the guest house. I got to meet some interesting people at the table. There were two Chileans, Nidia and Khaviet, who were travelling together. They had been in New Zealand before this and had been away from home for a long time now. There was also a French woman in her middle ages who ran a guest house in Morocco. She had some interesting stories to tell about the Arab people and the business she was trying to set up in Cambodia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to go to the beach after the breakfast. Lisa was going out to meet her friends. I decided to walk the 5 odd kilometers to &lt;strong&gt;An Bang beach&lt;/strong&gt;. Nidia and Khaviet crossed me on their bikes just outside the town. I waved them goodbye and told them I might see them at the beach. The town had ended quite abruptly and the fields had replaced the buildings. This level of planning seems uncomfortably unnatural to me. There was a pretty canal running along the country road. I felt like jumping into the water to seek respite from the harsh sun. I was really missing my hat. üò´&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The road led to the main highway and I hastened to the beach. There were quite a few tourists going to or coming back from the beach on their bicycles. I could see just one man walking ahead of me. We caught up with each other and exchanged hellos right before the beach. He asked me where I was from and the conversation started thus. This was Robert from Malta. I blurted the first thing that came to my mind when he told me his country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1TnzCiUSI0&#34;&gt;The Italian Man who Went to Malta!&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;You know about that one, eh?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; he laughed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew that one by heart but I had never known that Malta was a small island country off the coast of Italy. We stuck together as we searched for a place on the crowded beach. The beach was much more beautiful than I had expected. We went past the beach chairs being sold and found a shaded spot under some plants to keep our bags in. The sun was blazing hot and the sea felt nice and pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;instagram-media&#34; data-instgrm-version=&#34;7&#34; style=&#34; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;padding:8px;&#34;&gt; &lt;div style=&#34; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&#34;&gt; &lt;div style=&#34; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&#34; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/p/BHDEGhRBtQN/&#34; style=&#34; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;A photo posted by Karan (@grasskode)&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;time style=&#34; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&#34; datetime=&#34;2016-06-24T18:49:34+00:00&#34;&gt;Jun 24, 2016 at 11:49am PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert and I talked about a lot of things. He was an electrical engineer and was working for a company in London that made embedded products. He wanted to learn programming. He even told me they were looking for someone who coded in C and I could apply if I was interested. He compared how the cultures of London and Malta were different. We talked about food, Hindu religion, Shiva as a cool god, India for tourists and many more random topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8417/28811708262_643e8b4616.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;an-bang-5&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Clicking in the sea&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got out of the water after having spent more than an hour in it. I had no idea that the sun can burn your skin even when you are submerged in water. Well, now I know. We decided to grab something to eat and a beer in one of the restaurants around the beach. I tried the &lt;strong&gt;Banh Vac&lt;/strong&gt;, also known as the white rose dumpling. It was delicious but not very filling, so I ordered a &lt;strong&gt;Cao Lau&lt;/strong&gt; as well, another H·ªôi An specialty. Robert tried a grilled fish which was delicious and somewhat inexpensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Cao Lau&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We drank a couple of beers and talked some more. The &lt;strong&gt;brexit&lt;/strong&gt; result had just come out and Robert was a bit bummed as to what would happen to his employment terms. We speculated some and then simply shrugged our shoulders. Robert was planning to go back into the sea after the lunch but I had had enough. I bid him goodbye and headed back to the room in the blazing sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Crossing farms in the blazing sun&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;lessons-in-partying&#34;&gt;Lessons in Partying&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a new guy in the room. This was Lisa&amp;rsquo;s Mexican friend, Juan. He was a cool guy and liked talking. We talked a bit about how every place has it&amp;rsquo;s own peculiarities. He lives in Mexico City and travels 20 kms to work everyday, which takes him 2.5 hours one way. I cannot imagine spending 5 hours in commute every single day! Lisa and Juan were heading out to meet friends and even I grabbed my bag and thought of heading to the old town to eat something more and then check out the pub the Chileans had told me about over breakfast that morning. But Yum caught me on the way out and told me about the &amp;ldquo;family dinner&amp;rdquo; that they were having at the guest house that night. Lisa and Juan had plans but they insisted that I say a yes, and so I did! There was just an hour to go for dinner time, so I decided to hit a cafe nearby. I killed the hour writing and chatting with a 4 year old who was speaking randomly in English. üòÇ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8107/28811706432_1ab1faf41b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;cafe&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Cuteness!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I returned to the guest house by 7 and helped Yum set the dinner table. There were more people in the guest house than what I had expected. There were two Dutch Girls (Hannah and Anna Marie), two Dutch Guys (Shtein and Khaish), two Irish guys (Pierce and Ronan) and the Chileans from the morning. And then there was me, the only person not traveling with a mate. Yum and some other Vietnamese staff joined us and we ate some delicious home made food. We talked a lot and then Shtein brought out his guitar. He played really good and so we asked for some beers and sang lots of songs. They wanted to hear a Hindi song, so I tried the first one that comes to my mind when a guitar is around - &lt;em&gt;Dooba Dooba&lt;/em&gt;. Shtein managed to get the chords right and we somehow managed the song. üé∏&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We partied till 10 in the guest house; we had to end early because it was a home stay in the middle of a residential area. But we decided to continue the party in a pub. We went to the same one that I had got a flier for the previous day - &lt;strong&gt;Funky Monkey&lt;/strong&gt;. All, except the Chileans who had left when the jamming had started, stuffed themselves in a taxi and left for the old town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8400/28917071265_756831320f.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;clubbing-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Funky Monkey&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funky Monkey was &lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt;. It was not all that crowded and you could put on your own songs, which the Dutch people did. We drank and danced. The Dutch really know how to let their hair down. They are not bothered by how they are dancing or what steps look &amp;ldquo;cool&amp;rdquo;.  They taught me some funny steps which I probably do not remember anymore; we smoked a hookah; drank rum and coke and were given 1+1. It turned out to be much more fun than I had thought it would be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8839/28631835580_87040ec4b2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;clubbing-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;The gang&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had to stop around 12 though when the pub closed its doors. The Dutch guys were supposed to drive to Hu·∫ø in the morning so we said goodbye to them. Khaish, who looks weirdly similar to &lt;a href=&#34;http://img01.static.images-di.se/SiteImages/2016/01/17/thumbnails/p_zlatan-1169.jpg&#34;&gt;Zlatan Ibrahimovich&lt;/a&gt;, was pretty drunk and gaily kissed me goodbye. He told me something about &amp;ldquo;no borders&amp;rdquo; that I wanted to remember but cannot. However, the party had not ended yet for the rest of us. A man roped us in for another pub. He arranged motorbike drops to this place and we were probably the only ones in this pub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8796/28631832190_7b2beb27cd.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;clubbing-3&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Everything was hazy by now üòù&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a pool table and we started playing. Everyone was drunk and the Irish were hitting on the Dutch. Ronen took me aside and told me he had a chance with the blonde one who I was playing a match with. I happily stepped aside and let him play to which he told me I was his new favourite mate. üòÇ I played with the bartender after they finished. She beat me two games in a row though they were extremely close. I bought her a drink to show my appreciation for beating a drunken me. I played a little foosball with Ronen and then we left for the guest house. 3 motorbikes. I was with a ladyboy I think but people&amp;rsquo;s genders or sexualities do not really make me uncomfortable. We got to the guest house and the man who was the ringleader wanted 100k per bike! I handed a 20k bill for mine and told him that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t drunk enough to pay any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lisa was on the top of the gate when we reached. She and Juan had reached just then as well and had found the gate locked. I showed them the key which was kept where we had discussed with the guest house owners and we laughed about it a bit. Everyone sat around and talked in hushed tones once we were all in. I was decently drunk so I left for the room and sat talking to Juan inside. He had travelled to Nepal as well - Kathmandu and Everest base camp. Somehow the topic of my marriage came up again and I explained it to him as I had done to so many already. He kept laughing throughout. üòê My head was spinning and I passed out soon after. It must have been 4 in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-day-in-da-nang&#34;&gt;A Day in Da Nang&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up around noon next day with a headache and a terrible hangover. My room mates had a good laugh about it when they came back from the beach. I decided to cure my condition by taking a walk to find some food. I walked till &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g298082-d4308916-Reviews-Madam_Khanh_The_Banh_Mi_Queen-Hoi_An_Quang_Nam_Province.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madame Khanh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a small place which is famous for it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;B√°nh M√¨&lt;/strong&gt;. H·ªôi An has the best &lt;em&gt;B√°nh M√¨s&lt;/em&gt; in Vietnam and Madame Khanh does a really good one. She is an old lady who is as much of a tourist attraction herself as her sandwiches. One of her sandwich and a Ca Phe Sua Da eased my hangover by various degrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8646/28811705622_3fe17b4692.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;madame-khanh&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Cure for a hangover&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had just walked into the ancient town when I got Daniel&amp;rsquo;s ping on my phone. He and his friend were planning to catch a Vietnamese League football match in Da Nanag. He asked if I was interested and I said I was. I asked him when the match was. It was at 5 PM that evening! I checked the time; 2 PM. I rushed back to the local bus stand, which was a little before the guest house I was putting up in. I took the shortest route shown by Google Maps and in keeping with shortest routes, this one went through some quaint parts of the town. A real old town with old buildings and no tickets. There were some farms as well and at the end of the road, the bus stand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8406/28917065125_7734cb07e9.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;farms-3&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Farms en route to the bus stand&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a bus waiting when I got to the stand. I got in and the bus started in 15 minutes or so. It took the bus 40 minutes to get to Da Nang. This was the Bus Number 1 that is so notorious all over the online forms for overcharging foreigners. I don&amp;rsquo;t think the westerners get the concept of cheap bus travel. The ticket is for the passenger only. Any considerable luggage fetches an extra price, both, from foreigners as well as locals. I paid the usual 20 kVND and faced no problems whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Da Nang I got off a little before the stadium to try a few ATMs before walking to the stadium. I met up with Daniel and his friend, Andy, next to the stadium. They had already bought their tickets and I got mine as well. The tickets were being sold in black all over the place with the policemen standing in indifference. I got a 25k ticket for 30k; in 90 INR I had got the best tier ticket. üòÑ This was one of the cheapest tickets I have ever purchased!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8752/28917064305_c3633dc89c.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;danang-stadium-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Chi Lang Stadium&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was still time for the match so we sat drinking beer in a shop right opposite to the entrance. There was a brief and heavy rain which let up just in time for the match. We talked about the &lt;strong&gt;brexit&lt;/strong&gt; mostly. These guys, both British, thought it was a stupid decision for the UK to exit the EU. There might be some good reasons to exit the EU but this decision was made for all the wrong ones. Also, the referendum had shown that the English were the only ones who wanted to exit. The Scots and Irish had wanted to remain in the EU and now there was a possibility of them exiting the UK to remain in the EU. Otherwise there needed to be a checkpoint between Ireland and Northern Ireland which would strain the peace treaty between the nations. They said that the trade might suffer as well. I pointed out that there were other nations that were not a part of EU but had trade agreements with them; Switzerland for example. But Switzerland was not a good place for working class people, they explained. We discussed implications like lack of skilled workers, the problem with restricted movement, lack of environmental and economic regulations. There were many things that they found bothering and this was one decision that would probably not be reversed till it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it was time, we picked up some 10k &lt;em&gt;B√°nh M√¨s&lt;/em&gt; and went into the stadium. There was not a &lt;strong&gt;huge&lt;/strong&gt; crowd but the stadium had a considerable audience. The seats were alright and we had a nice view of the entire ground. Da Nang in orange was playing H·∫£i Ph√≤ng in white. Da Nang was third in the V.League table and H·∫£i Ph√≤ng were the current leaders. The match had it&amp;rsquo;s thrill. They played the Vietnamese national anthem at the beginning of the match. People stood up and continued doing whatever it was that they were doing; smoking a cigarette, or texting; I continued eating my sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;VIDEO : Moments from the match&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The match itself was quite interesting. The quality of football was much better than I had been expecting. There were a few good moves. Jersey number 99 of Da Nang scored twice and H·∫£i Ph√≤ng lost their momentum. One of the H·∫£i Ph√≤ng player was shown a red card as well. The match was an enjoyable experience; one that I would repeat gladly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We split up after the match. The guys were staying in Lang Co which was a little north of Da Nang and looked pretty in the pictures. Daniel told me to hit him up if I was ever returning to Saigon. I rushed to see if I could still find a bus. It was already 7 PM. The buses stop around 6 PM apparently. I considered hitchhiking but how was I to know which car or bike was heading to H·ªôi An? I was certainly not getting a 300k taxi. I decided to stay in Da Nang and hop cafes and watch the Euro matches before taking an early bus out to H·ªôi An. There was time for the matches to start so I went to the riverside and walked along the promenade. Da Nang is one of the prettiest cities I have ever seen. I really liked the lights and the lack of any kind of rush that one sees in a city so big.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8659/28299220254_0058839ee7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;danang-lights-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8654/28841246041_b506c93cf6.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;danang-lights-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Bright lights, big city!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took some photos and then dived into the maze of roads again. I found a place to eat and got some Pho for dinner. The match had started by the time I ended my dinner and I decided to find a cafe to sit and enjoy the match in. This turned out to be quite a challenge. The street-side cafes that are omnipresent elsewhere in Vietnam seemed to be a rarity in Da Nang (at least in the part of the city I was in). I had to walk all the way back to the stadium to find a place and I missed the first 25 minutes consequently. Even this cafe was going to close at 10 PM. So much for my cafe hopping plans!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the match went into overtime, I decided to check out a hostel nearby. This one was offering me a free drop to H·ªôi An in the morning. I got to Funtastic Hostel and talked to the manager over phone since the guy at the reception did not speak English. I explained the situation to him telling him that I wanted to spend the night but did not have my passport on me. I could mail him a scanned copy though, which I did and we decided on a price close to agoda&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I sat in the common room watching the rest of the matches while the staff snored away next to me. I was the only one up to watch football this late in the night. After the matches I went to my bed only to find it occupied by someone. I woke up the staff to ask him if there was another bed I could sleep in but he did not understand my request. He went into the room, switched on the lights and started creating a havoc that would have woken everyone up. I told him to quit it and that I would sleep in the common room instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I slept for the few hours before the hostel woke up. I was somewhat frustrated with the night&amp;rsquo;s mix up and the unapologetic nature of the manager and staff in the morning. It is at times like these that I regret not having booked through agoda or some place where I could share my experience with a bad review. Anyway, I availed the excuse for a free breakfast and took the drop to H·ªôi An.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;coffee-and-memories&#34;&gt;Coffee and Memories&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was just another girl from this hostel. She was one of the rare Germans who do not have a thick accent. The van stopped at the beach-side franchise of the same hostel and loads of people got in. There were three groups, out of which two were from Canada. They got talking and the rest got listening. One was a couple of law students. The girl, who was doing most of the talking, was English by her accent, had been in Canada for 5 years and &amp;ldquo;never want[ed] to leave!&amp;ldquo;. Her voice was overspilling with the arrogance that I find utmost irritating. She was full of despise for the people of China and Vietnam. The other group was of two guys, one of whom did most of the talking. He was studying in Canada as well. These are the kind of people who are surprised and irritated at finding 20 people in a line at Shanghai airport. I pray they never come to India. A dialogue went as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There were 20 people waiting and those guys did not open another security post!&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;20? Really?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s why we always take the express check-ins.&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;Fuck your money! Really!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason this irritated me to no end. It was economic casteism, at it&amp;rsquo;s best, being paraded in front of me. I could have expressed my disdain but I reasoned that it would have been pointless to educate their elite western ego. I held my tongue and suffered the rest of the journey, which fortunately, was not long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a drop close to the hostel. As I walked the rest of the way, a few Vietnamese children started an impromptu conversation with me. They were from a province nearby and were here on vacation. Their guardian stood smiling a few steps behind as I exchanged names and shook hands with the children. I adore such confidence in kids so young, mostly because I remember having very little at their age. I still suffer from lack of confidence when it comes to talking to people at random but I am working on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I got to the guest house, I found that Lisa had left and Juan was highly amused as to where I had been missing all night. Yum told me later that he had expressed concern to her as well. Good man. üòä I apologised and reiterated my story for his benefit. He &amp;ldquo;pfft&amp;rdquo;ed as he usually did and laughed it off. Then he left for the beach and I for the old town. I wandered around hunting for a good deal for a bus ticket to my next destination. Nothing felt right. I wound up on the riverside road in the old town and the music in one of the cafes caught my attention. Unlike the others, no one was calling out to me from inside. I walked up to take a look at the menu before the woman inside took notice of me and asked me to come in. There was just another old man sitting there who turned out to be the owner of the cafe. I ordered a Ca Phe Sua Da and sat listening to old French ballads, watching the people pass by on the road in front and the river beyond. It was quite beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old man, Mr. Kim, eventually asked me where I was from. He smiled when I told him I was from India and then produced a register at a page where another Indian had written something. I could not read since it was in Malayalam (I am guessing since the man had mentioned Kerala in his signature). Then I flipped through the pages and read random memories from people who had visited this cafe over time. The coffee and the memories registered in these pages complimented each other wonderfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8629/28917060665_ae50899e34.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;cafe-des-amis-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;A perfect mix&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a bit I started working on my laptop and ordered something to eat. A younger man came in and started playing Chinese Chess with Mr. Kim. The game seemed pretty cool and Mr. Kim was killing his opponent. I looked around at the obviously photoshopped images of his younger self with some French men. The woman put a register in front of me when I finished my meal. These guys had a very unique way of keeping reviews. In a world where tripadvisor was the word of truth, and this is specially true for H·ªôi An where every cafe flashes it&amp;rsquo;s tripadvisor rating to draw customers in, this cafe was doing it in the old school way. I wrote my review and ordered another coffee as a new round of Chinese Chess started at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g298082-d1121821-Reviews-Cafe_des_Amis-Hoi_An_Quang_Nam_Province.html&#34;&gt;Cafe Des Amis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were more people who were coming in and the woman was growing impatient with me. The cafes in H·ªôi An are somewhat weird. They are not the usual cafes where you can sit and work at leisure. There seems to be a pressure to either give a constant business or be gone. Anyway, I left after the coffee and walked back to the hostel while booking a bus ticket en route. I spent some time in the guest house working on a blog post. Juan came in from the beach and was planning to go meet some of his Spanish friends in the old town. I headed out for some Pho and then caught a Euro match in the town&amp;rsquo;s Man U Cafe. I think they have one of those in every village. üòÇ I went back to the room and slept early to make up for last night&amp;rsquo;s misadventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;southward&#34;&gt;Southward&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up the next day and watched the Copa finals with Juan. The referee played spoilsport and handed out two unnecessary reds. It did not seem like a football match anymore. Everyone ran around tired, missing passes and shots. It was a pathetic final, undeserving of the amazing competition that the Copa had been thus far. The match went into penalties. The big names missed their chances and Chile won on penalties for the second year running against the same opponent. Messi announced his &lt;a href=&#34;http://grasskode.xyz/post/rant/mexit/&#34;&gt;retirement from international football&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had breakfast in the guest house and talked to Yum a bit about tourism in H·ªôi An. Incredibly, there was a time when tourists were not able to find places to stay in H·ªôi An. The government had then started encouraging home stays. Anyway, I checked out and payed the bill which was not as hefty as I was expecting. I saw a small kitten near the reception while I was walking out. It was so little that it was difficult to spot on the floor!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8636/28917052175_c5fde4a8c7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;kitten-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Unfortunately I am not a cat person&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dropped my bag at the &lt;strong&gt;Sinh Tourist&lt;/strong&gt; office and went to look for a cafe to sit and work in. I sat in a large and spacious one with lots of open green space. Despite there being no customers around, I was rushed here as well. I walked out after my second coffee because my laptop was running out of battery and there was no power point to be seen. I walked back to the bus company office and ran into Juan right in front of it. He was also leaving the city today and had his bus out later that evening. He, however, had used his time better to do some sightseeing in the old town. He showed me some pictures he had taken and then we said goodbye once more. I sat in another cafe to charge my laptop, eat some noodles and drink a strange chilli-mango smoothie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was eventually time to cramp myself up in another bus. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how people taller than me, and there are plenty of them, travel in these things. I slept, worked and watched football through the night as the bus made it&amp;rsquo;s way southward to Nha Trang.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>

&lt;p&gt;It seems like I had been planning a solo backpacking trip overseas for ages. In late May 2016, I finally took off for a trip through South East Asia like I had always wanted to. I was dismissive of all deterring arguments. I cared not what was happening to me or around me. This trip was all that mattered right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is about when I got to Hu·∫ø in central Vietnam. I took a train from Dong Hoi. Hu·∫ø was the last imperial capital of Vietnam as well as one of the border towns in the north south civil war. It has a lot of history to it and some specialty cuisines as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;hues-of-hu·∫ø&#34;&gt;Hues of Hu·∫ø&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked out of the station after saying goodbye to Bibi and Miss Han. Google Maps showed that the hotel I had booked was just 1.5 kms away so I did not even consider the many &lt;em&gt;xe om&lt;/em&gt; drivers offering me a drop. Hu·∫ø seemed like a lively town. It was lit up and people sat in restaurants and cafes enjoying food and drinks. I liked the vibes of this place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8297/28877706956_13400247cd.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;hue-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Lively colours of Hu·∫ø&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to the hostel quickly enough. It was immediately south of one of the hospitals, well before the backpacker district. I had booked a single room that was falling in my budget. It had been a while since I had spent some time in the comfort of having no one around. I gladly accepted this break from hostels and all their activity and socialising. I am not a very social person to begin with. Anyway, since I was getting a single room with good reviews at a fraction more than what a hostel dorm would have cost me, I was up to spending a night in my preferred style!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hotel, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.agoda.com/bien-khoi-hostel/hotel/hue-vn.html&#34;&gt;Bien Khoi&lt;/a&gt;, was a little off the spot marked on Google Maps but a local helped me find it. This was a new hotel; just 30 days new. The woman at the reception barely spoke any English but one of her friends helped us out. I made more use of the Google Translate app as well. The narrow stairway led me to the third floor where my room was. It seemed nice and simple. It even had a balcony which I used just once during my stay. All in all, I would say, I had got a good bargain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8230/28804037512_80e1334df7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bien-khoi-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Private room!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quickly took a bath and went out to get something to eat. It was getting late and Vietnam&amp;rsquo;s more local food joints tend to close early. I got &lt;em&gt;c∆°m chi√™n&lt;/em&gt; (fried rice) from a restaurant and then went ahead to check out the backpacker district which Michaella had told me about. The lights got brighter and the streets livelier as I approached the area. The &lt;em&gt;xe om&lt;/em&gt; and cyclo riders also started pestering me. They offered me everything from opium to prostitutes. I went into my WTF mode. I had gotten into the habit of politely refusing any offers made to me but there were so many of them here that I quickly learnt to ignore. Then there were some that tried to get your attention in any possible way. One of the &lt;em&gt;xe om&lt;/em&gt; riders rode for 50-80 feet along my side constantly talking to me and showing me a packet of marijuana that he thought would interest me. Smacking him across the face would have interested me but I refrained for the fear of prolonged engagement. I walked straight out of the area, ditching my previous plan to grab a drink somewhere. I understand that people like to party and I have nothing against them or those who facilitate it in any way, but I do not understand why they cannot leave alone the ones who don&amp;rsquo;t want to join in! Anyway, the offers by cyclo and motorbike riders continued for a bit and then stopped when I had put enough distance between myself and the ghetto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8853/28293574093_65144cd0d7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;hue-riverside-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Riverside&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked to the river side and walked along the empty street. The shops had closed down and there was barely any tourist to be seen. A few artists were engaged in creating amazing pieces that they would sell at unjustified low prices the next day. I preferred such peace and quiet more than the loud tourist areas. I walked around a bit before heading back to the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/140507143@N02/28293540173/in/album-72157671174977510/&#34; title=&#34;woodart&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8788/28293540173_b38f1cdc62.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;woodart&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;VIDEO : Creating art&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;imperial-capital&#34;&gt;Imperial Capital&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a really peaceful sleep and woke up late the next day. I decided to stay another night in this place and talked to the hotel manager about a suitable price. We agreed on the one agoda was listing. I am really curious about how that site works. Most of the hotels demand a higher rate when I ask them either for an extension or if I simply walk in to book a bed. One would have thought that agoda would be the more expensive of the two since there might be some service fee involved but it has never been so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I went out and looked for one of the more famous &lt;strong&gt;B√∫n b√≤ Hu·∫ø&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://goo.gl/maps/a2VWoHhi49K2&#34;&gt;shops&lt;/a&gt;. This dish is, as the name makes obvious, a specialty of Hu·∫ø. It is the classic &lt;em&gt;B√∫n b√≤&lt;/em&gt; noodle soup done in the imperial style of Hu·∫ø. I found the place and relished a large bowl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I went to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g293926-d1121808-Reviews-Mandarin_Cafe-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html&#34;&gt;Mandarin Cafe&lt;/a&gt;, one of my wikivoyage discoveries. I am really glad of having gone to this one. The owner is a photographer and there are many excellent photographs of Vietnam on display. They are up for sale if any interests you. I had a banana pancake and a coffee and inquired about the rates of the buses to H·ªôi An. Then I picked up the map of the walking tour, the real reason I had gone to the Mandarin Cafe. The map and advice for the walking tour were free of cost. They even gave me a nice post card compliments of the restaurant. üòÄ I like such traveller friendly places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hu·∫ø was the last imperial capital of Vietnam. It was also a main player in the civil war that brought about the socialist revolution. The &lt;strong&gt;Perfume River&lt;/strong&gt; runs through the city and while most of the hotels and backpacker areas are south of the river, the north has the picturesque old city with a walled citadel. The walking tour map traced a nice route through the old city and gave a short history of every place of interest that would lie on the route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I crossed the &lt;strong&gt;Tr∆∞·ªùng Ti·ªÅn&lt;/strong&gt; bridge to the other side of the Perfume River which was pretty wide. The sun was not too hot and that made for a pleasant walk. I turned into one of the roads and entered the citadel through one of the many gates. There was the first layer of moat here and the wall was an impressive 8 meters wide fortification. It reminded me of the old Indian cities like Jaipur, just much less crowded.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Entering the citadel&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;War Museum&lt;/strong&gt; was up first but I seemed to have come in at the lunch hours. I decided to go ahead and come back for the museum if I felt like it. There were huge fighter jets and artillery guns on display that memorialized the civil war of Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8018/28623878310_38716618d5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;war-museum-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Passing the War Museum&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to the Imperial Museum next but it required a ticket which was the same as the one for the Imperial Palace. I walked along the southern wall of the palace complex and came upon the ticket counter, only to decide against buying the ticket. It cost a dear 150 kVND and I was not sure I wanted to see another palace. I assumed palaces are all similar inside; bedrooms and meeting rooms and halls for entertainment. I would have been interested in the Imperial Museum but there was no separate ticket for it. So I decided to forget all about the palace and the museums and enjoy the walk in the citadel. There was a big flag right opposite to the grand entrance of the palace and the two entrances to the citadel right next to the flag were flanked by big cannon guns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8828/28623876300_d846483412.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;flag-2&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Big flag and big guns&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked along the well shaded pathways on the outside of the palace moat. The moat was full of lotuses, flower that I had fallen in love with. I had not seen many lotuses in India and I had never seen ones as beautiful as I was seeing here. Incidentally, lotus is the national flower of Vietnam as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other side of the street had a variety of shops; mostly clothes, bikes and daily needs. I did the southern and western walls and then took the by-lanes into the more residential parts of the citadel. There was a lotus plantation of sorts and impressive street art to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8593/28877678986_e8dbb7e250.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;streetart-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Streetart!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I walked back to exit the citadel from the Eastern side, I ran into a wholesale market of electric appliances, fabric, motorbikes and what not! Outside the citadel was the more famous local market - &lt;strong&gt;Cho Dong Ba&lt;/strong&gt;. They had everything one could ask for. The back lane even had specialty shops for eggs and bananas!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8629/28291339274_215e5f6ab1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;market-5&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Most unexpected specialty shops&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked back across the river over the Tr∆∞·ªùng Ti·ªÅn Bridge and went to the Church that marked the end of the walking tour. I decided to head back to my room, which was close by, to cool down and rest my tired legs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;culture-exchange&#34;&gt;Culture Exchange&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to try some local food and I looked some places online and decided on a particular road to explore. I went to a more busy joint at the end of this road, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g293926-d3809346-Reviews-Hanh_Restaurant-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html&#34;&gt;Hanh Restaurant&lt;/a&gt;. This place was full of locals, which is always a good sign. It looked a little more expensive than my usual choices but I decided to sit myself down. The rice wraps were the snack of choice all around me but I was not in the mood of that one again. So I ordered a couple of new snacks from the menu. The waiter helped me choose them and offered to bring me half a plate of each. When the snacks came, he also explained how they were eaten. I liked the rice pudding one (B√°nh n·∫≠m) but did not like the shrimp tapioca thing (B√°nh b·ªôt l·ªçc) all that much. I topped off the snacks with a glass of delicious fruit yoghurt (fruit &lt;em&gt;lassi&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8707/28804025282_165d969dd7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;banh-nam&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;B√°nh n·∫≠m&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I went to the parks and walking street along the river. This place had it&amp;rsquo;s share of people. Hu·∫ø seemed to attract a lot of Vietnamese tourists as well. I was walking along the street taking pictures of the Tr∆∞·ªùng Ti·ªÅn Bridge when a young girl walked up to me and started talking. She was a student and wanted to practice her English. Could I spare a few minutes to help her out? Of course I could! We sat next to the river and she started asking me the usual questions that must have formed her repertoire for foreigners. Where was I from? How long had I been in Vietnam? Where all had I travelled? I asked her some questions as well. Her name was Gau and she was from H·ªôi An. She was studying medicine in Hu·∫ø. She told me, as I was to find out in a few days myself, that H·ªôi An was famous for cheap and good quality clothes. She did not know what Hu·∫ø was famous for. She was in the fifth year of her six year course. It took money or family connections to have a good career in Vietnam. She said she might just start a private practice after completing her education. Another friend of hers, An, joined us later. They knew that India had tropical climate like Vietnam&amp;rsquo;s. But did India have snow? I told them it did, high up in the mountains. They were quite fascinated by snow, having never had seen it. Vietnam did not have snow in any part of the country. Once we had exhausted the possible list of questions, I expressed my desire to continue walking and we said goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8150/28293542683_a7f769b7d8.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;truong-tien-bridge-4&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Tr∆∞·ªùng Ti·ªÅn lights up&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must have walked barely fifty steps when another girl came up to me with a similar request. I nodded in agreement. I could not think of a better way to spend my evening. I sat down with her and another male friend of hers and we started talking. Another guy with pretty good English joined us later. These were Loan, Hom and Lin, in that order. The starting questions were done and dusted soon enough. Hom was studying law and we talked about the economies of our countries, the taxes and other similar things. He said he thought I was friendly and smiled a lot. I think that is one of the most important things I have learnt on this trip. They were impressed by my pronunciation of Vietnamese words, which is not at all an easy task for foreigners. They wanted to know how I found the traffic in Vietnam, another thing that the foreigners usually struggle with. I shrugged my shoulders and told them that this was nothing compared to what we had in India. üòé Lin wanted to know why the women in India wear a red spot (&lt;em&gt;bindi&lt;/em&gt;) on their foreheads. Loan wanted to know why we use our right hands in particular to eat. Then we got around to the subject of patriarchy. Vietnam has made long strides towards equality of genders. The men and women share the work outside and inside households. Loan told me that she had come to know that Indian men came back from work and did nothing while the women worked, cleaned and cooked. Much to my shame, I told her that it was quite true. But things were changing slowly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shoutout&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop being chauvinist pigs. Those of us who travel do not like to be put into embarrassing positions because of your stupidity. üòí&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what about religion? I told them that our predominant religions were Hinduism and Islam. Vietnam&amp;rsquo;s were Buddhism and Christianity, though there was an increasing number of non-religious people in Vietnam. In fact, Vietnam is one of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://humannationalityvn.blogspot.com/2015/11/the-chaging-trend-of-religions-in.html&#34;&gt;most non-religious&lt;/a&gt; countries in the world. Out here, they called these non-religious people &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo;, which, as per me, was a very apt way to put it. These guys were free; I told them that so was I. üòá&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked around some more after leaving the three. It had been an interesting day and I was starting to like the town a little despite the irritating cyclo and motorbike riders. I ate &lt;strong&gt;C∆°m B√¨nh D√¢n&lt;/strong&gt;, the commoner&amp;rsquo;s rice, that night. It was simply rice with an assortment of vegetables and meat. Cheap and filling as I like it. I ended the meal with a mango smoothie before heading to the room for another night of peaceful sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8711/28877646856_c6e22b399e.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;com-binh-dan-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Typical C∆°m B√¨nh D√¢n stall&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;royal-tombs&#34;&gt;Royal Tombs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I changed to a new hostel after waking up. I went back to the B√∫n b√≤ Hu·∫ø place on the way and ate a bowl for breakfast. The new hostel seemed quite nice. It was outside the backpacker area and so there were less people around and I got my quiet. I rented out a bicycle for a nominal charge of 1 USD and took it for a ride. This was a city bike without gears and the roads turned out to be a bit challenging as soon as I left the city. I was planning to do a few royal tombs around town today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I headed to the &lt;strong&gt;Tomb of T·ª± ƒê·ª©c&lt;/strong&gt;, the one that was closest to the city. I rode on the main highway for some time before diving into the country roads. Google Map led me through quaint alleys before dropping me at the entrance of the tomb. It looked like a modest complex with a few shops that had set themselves up in front of the ticket counter. They invited me to avail free parking in their premises but I chose to pay the nominal 2 kVND parking for a cycle instead of risking a misunderstanding later on. The ticket to the tomb turned out to be a 100 kVND affair. I shook my head and bought the ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first building was the living quarters of T·ª± ƒê·ª©c and later became his temple. T·ª± ƒê·ª©c was the last emperor who enjoyed real power in Vietnam; he was followed by puppet kings installed by the French. This was his holiday palace, something of a retreat. The house was in the typical style of the old structures (temples and schools) I had seen in Hanoi. There was the courtyard and a backyard. The entire complex was pretty and big. It was interesting how the emperor had lived in utmost, though not overt, luxury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8785/28908984465_f122fbdb3a.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tu-duc-temple-6&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;T·ª± ƒê·ª©c&#39;s temple&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a lake in front of the building and an islet in the middle of it. It used to be populated with exotic birds and animals; the emperor enjoyed boat rides and walks there. Now there were just withering lotuses in the lake and lots of workers working on some project to beautify the islet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8683/28293550533_52bf150a8f.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tu-duc-complex-lake&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Lake and islet&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The living quarters had a throne room where you could rent out &amp;ldquo;royal&amp;rdquo; clothes and sit on the throne or palanquin to take pictures. üëë üì∑ üòÖ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8706/28833464971_1a17f3521a.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tu-duc-temple-10&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Royal palanquin&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was also a small sales counter for some impressive local art. Vietnam has the most beautiful quality of local artwork I have seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next building was the tomb and it was very strikingly different in architecture from the living quarter. The living quarters heeded to the emperor&amp;rsquo;s requirements in life and the tomb represented his journey in death. There is the courtyard with waiting stone mandarins and royal rides (horses and elephants) made of stone. These were arranged in two neat rows on either side. The courtyard led to a huge stone tablet up ahead that was inscribed with some script. The tablet and it&amp;rsquo;s shelter were flanked by two obelisks, one on either side. Further ahead was a walled enclosure with a gate. This enclosure contained the actual tomb in it&amp;rsquo;s center and felt something like a fairly simple maze. It was grand and quite morbid, as is to be expected of tombs. There were very few people around so it made for good photographs as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;T·ª± ƒê·ª©c&#39;s tomb&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met a guy from Cyprus (first Cypriot I have met) in the complex. He was on a vacation with his mother who he had managed to lose somehow. üòÇ He was in his middle ages and had been to India and had loved it! I think this is undoubtedly the best part about being an Indian traveller. You meet a lot of people have been to India and more often than not, they remember it fondly. This makes them smile in reminiscence and treat you with a warm bias when they talk to you. It is funny how you get to know more about your country and culture when you leave it. I walked around the other parts of the complex after T·ª± ƒê·ª©c&amp;rsquo;s tomb. There were some lesser known tombs of the other royal family members up ahead; some under renovation, some left to their abject state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Po&#39;ing around&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really liked this place, though the 100k still seemed too much. I walked around the extensive complex and ended up in the building next to the lake. I sat down to rest and enjoy the view. A tourist group came in after a while and the musicians, who had been resting, began to play. However, I was preparing to leave just then so I could appreciate the music very briefly. The instruments were interesting; strings, flutes and everyday things like cups and sticks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was planning to do some more tombs and I asked Google Maps for the route to the one closest to where I was. It took me through a pine plantation and village roads! I really prefer such small unused roads to the big highways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8788/28877658186_e7bea134ee.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;road-pine-forestation&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Pine plantation&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached the &lt;strong&gt;Tomb of Thi·ªáu Tr·ªã&lt;/strong&gt; in a short while. It seemed like an off-route place with very few tourists and I was half expecting there to be no ticket for this one. But there turned out to be one, and it was a 40 kVND worth. üò£ Hu·∫ø had really costly tickets. I had found the entry fee in Hanoi pretty reasonable for single monuments and structures but Hu·∫ø was too expensive. This complex did not seem to be much cared for as well. It lay in ruins which was it&amp;rsquo;s primary difference from T·ª± ƒê·ª©c&amp;rsquo;s tomb. The actual tomb was much the same in layout, though much less grand and much more in shambles. But there were beautiful lotus lakes in front of and behind the tomb to make up for the lost architectural beauty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Waiting mandarins&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to T·ª± ƒê·ª©c&amp;rsquo;s there was a living quarter/temple here as well but it was much too bare. I felt like I was walking through someone&amp;rsquo;s home while they were out on a vacation (not that I have ever done such a thing!). There courtyard and backyard here were probably prettier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Thi·ªáu Tr·ªã&#39;s temple&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cat came out of somewhere to eye me suspiciously walking about the complex. I fancied it to be the ghost of one of the owners keeping an eye on my movements. There was a jackfruit tree with fruits hanging ripe and ready for the picking. It felt way too private for a tourist attraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8266/28877650986_a5e5610f49.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;thieu-tri-temple-cat&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Spooky cat don&#39;t like me&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked out of the complex and sat down on a bench to get my money&amp;rsquo;s worth. A dog waited for me to settle down before deciding to take a nap itself. I was not going for more tombs. I was financially done for the day. I left this complex around 5 PM and saw no one at the ticket counter. I might as well have come in at this time. üòê&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rode the bicycle back to the city, running into a small traffic jam right before entering it. I returned the bike at the hostel and took a bath before going back to Mandarin Cafe for some comfort food. Baked potatoes and chocolate shake. I sat in a cafe near the hostel and finished the &lt;a href=&#34;http://grasskode.xyz/post/readings/john-hick-philosophy-of-religion/&#34;&gt;Philosophy of Religion&lt;/a&gt; book that had finally got interesting towards the end. I also learnt the difference between a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ca Phe Sua Da&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bac Xiu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. I went back to the hostel to work a bit after asking if the cafe would be open for the match later in the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I returned to the cafe and sat watching the Austria vs Portugal match. A guy from Manchester, Daniel, joined me and we talked about football and travelling. He had travelled India extensively and used to be a bar manager back home. Interesting guy. He had taken up a job teaching English in HCMC and was travelling in Vietnam with a friend before joining the school next month. He told me about a football match that was going to take place in Da Nang the coming weekend and we exchanged contacts so that he could get in touch if the plan materialized. Him being a ManU fan, we discussed the Ronaldo-Messi rivalry. Daniel left after the first half and I sat doing the insta and watched the rest of the match because it was going in the funny freak football way that was to be typical of this Euro Cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;leaving-town&#34;&gt;Leaving Town&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up early for the Chile vs Colombia match that was delayed because of a storm. Chile won and progressed to the Copa finals. I booked a ticket to H·ªôi An from the hostel. It was some bus service that I had not heard about but I decided not to be paranoid and give it a shot. I had time so I worked a bit and went to a nearby &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g293926-d1724500-Reviews-Nina_s_Cafe-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html&#34;&gt;cafe&lt;/a&gt; that was a tripadvisor success. The food was nice but a bit expensive, although I guess everything would be expensive when compared to the streetside places that I usually haunt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8653/28877649796_ba8aae6c9e.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ninas-cafe-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Nina&#39;s Cafe&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it was time, I went downstairs and a minivan came to pick me up. I was dropped at the main office of the bus service where the bus stood waiting. This was a &amp;ldquo;sleeper&amp;rdquo; bus; two levels of reclining seats arranged in three rows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8645/28840461031_98f8494957.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;sleeper-bus&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Sleeper tourist bus&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is how most of the tourist buses in Vietnam are. I felt a bit uncomfortable and stuck in those seats which were not my size. I was sleepy though and managed to drift off to sleep despite the cramped seats, cold AC and loud Vietnamese comedy show that was playing in the bus. I woke up a couple of times to see beautiful sceneries drift past my window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8802/28840461281_7f6ddc42d4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bus-journey-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Through the window&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really liked Da Nang from what I saw while we crossed it. I had also gotten great reviews of the place from a few people during my travels. I was seriously considering coming to the city for a few days after H·ªôi An but my month in Vietnam was seeming too short now.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>

&lt;p&gt;It seems like I had been planning a solo backpacking trip overseas for ages. In late May 2016, I finally took off for a trip through South East Asia like I had always wanted to. I was dismissive of all deterring arguments. I cared not what was happening to me or around me. This trip was all that mattered right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to Dong Hoi on the recommendation of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14123807.Aniket_Ketkar&#34;&gt;Aniket&lt;/a&gt;, a really awesome guy whom I have not met yet but we share a few common friends. Dong Hoi was the closest beach-side town to Phong Nha National Park, a UNESCO World heritage site and home to some of the most impressive caves! I was more than glad to have taken Aniket&amp;rsquo;s advice and put this amazing place on my itinerary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;beachside-and-phong-nha&#34;&gt;Beachside and Phong Nha&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I opened my phone to see Nils&amp;rsquo; reply to my message. He had reached Dong Hoi at 4 in the morning! He had taken a bus to transport his bike and was now waiting for me at the railway station. I got off the train at Dong Hoi and met him in the station building. We fetched his bike and pushed it to a nearby fuel station for a refill. Then we rode to a hostel that Aniket had recommended so highly that Dong Hoi came on my Vietnam itinerary despite not having had made the first draft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g659924-d8527355-Reviews-Beachside_Backpackers-Dong_Hoi_Quang_Binh_Province.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beachside Backpackers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;! The hostel, as the name suggests, is right on the beach, a little distance from the town. I went in and spotted Michaella and went over to say a hi. Aniket had introduced us online and she recognised me immediately. I met An next and he welcomed me as well. These people really love Aniket! I heard so much about him in the few days I was here that it feels a little weird to know so much about a person you have never met. An and Michaella run Beachside in the warmest of ways and we were immediately made to feel at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sat around in the cafe for a bit and had our breakfast before checking into a room in the cafe. No one rushes you at Beachside; not for for anything. There is no rush to get a room, none to order food, none to pay your bills. It is a lesson in the art of chilling! There were a few people around; two girls who had come in by the train that morning, an Australian expat (let&amp;rsquo;s call him Mr. A since he will be featuring consistently in this post) with his half Vietnamese daughter. We hung about, eating, drinking and playing pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8211/28462589850_68df185626.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;beachside-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Parenting done right&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nils and I were thinking of doing something rather than spend the entire day lazing around. So we asked An for suggestions and he told us to go see the &lt;strong&gt;Phong Nha&lt;/strong&gt; cave. Mr. A gave us the details about how to get the bus, what it would cost, how to get tickets, etc. Armed with all the information, we stood on the road and waited about 10 minutes for the bus to come along. We hopped in and it took us through some beautiful countryside and to Phong Nha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything at Phong Nha was as Mr. A had told us it would be. We got to the ticket counter and were asked to arrange more people if we wanted to share a boat. There is a fixed price for a boat which can carry up to 12 people. It costs dearly to rent out a boat between two people but the price is much more reasonable when it is shared. But how does one arrange more people when there are no other tourists around? While we were looking around, a minibus stopped and a family of 9 Vietnamese got out. Their guide was going to the counter and Nils asked him if he would like to share the boat with us. He nodded. Great! The deal was that we did not pay for the boat but gave a generous tip of 100 kVND to the boatwomen. Good deal in all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8217/28131587263_25a20c92d7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;phong-nha-boat-ride-9&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Boat ride to Phong Nha Cave&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got talking to the Vietnamese family while the motorboat made the long way from the boarding point to the cave. The man and his wife were based in Arizona, America and they were visiting Vietnam with their kids. They were taking their family on a Saigon to Hanoi trip. Many things struck me oddly similar to the story of Indians who had moved abroad to seek a better future. We reached the cave and right from the entrance it struck me as grand. It was big and the river ran into it. The motors were turned off once we got to the mouth of the cave and the tour inside was done using rows. This was my first time seeing a cave like this. I had read about the &lt;strong&gt;stalagmites and stalactites&lt;/strong&gt; as a kid but had never seen something this big and beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7712/28715129236_d014a85f71.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;phong-nha-cave-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Stalagmites and Stalactites&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was blown away! These formations were so pretty and psychedelic. I imagined seeing mushrooms and trees on rocks, Buddha heads, migrating pilgrims, ET and many more sci-fi stuff! The guide was explaining a few things in Vietnamese and the American couple translated the more interesting bits for us. But frankly, I was content just looking at the wonderful formations and marvelling at nature. There were quite a few people here but the cave was so big that it did not feel crowded. I took a lot of pictures but soon figured out that pictures barely did any justice to the place. It was an actual three dimensional experience that needed to be felt in it&amp;rsquo;s entirety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many more pictures of the Phong Nha Cave in the album at the end of the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We came back after a round of the cave and thanked the Vietnamese family at the docking point and gave the tip that we had agreed upon. Then we sat down for some food and while we were paying the bill, the bus to Dong Hoi rolled past us. The next one was an hour later so we sat in the same cafe for a bit longer and had some more sugarcane juice and coffee. Nils learnt some Vietnamese from the girl who worked at the cafe. Then we were joined by the bus driver and conductor of the next bus to Dong Hoi and they asked us the English for breasts. üòÇ Men will be men, eh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at the hostel we went for a dip in the sea. The water was really cool and nice but there was a thunderstorm approaching. We got out, took showers and joined the barbecue party that the hostel had arranged for the night. It was a fun event with all you can eat barbecue buffet. All the hostel dwellers were there and many expats who were friends of An and Michaella. Mr. A was owning the conversation at my end of the table. We finished the food and sat around chatting about random things. It started drizzling and we finally went to the cafe when it picked up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nils, Mike (an American) and I sat playing cards. The girls from morning joined us : Paula, a Puerto Rican, and Whitney, an American. Mike left after a couple of games of rummy and then I taught the other guys &lt;em&gt;temperature&lt;/em&gt;. They caught up fast! Paula was extremely competitive and we played a few rounds before we decided to end the game. Nils, Whitney and I talked amongst each other and Paula went to talk to the Scots. Whitney was doing her PhD in Psychology. There was a lot of culture exchange about the three countries which is something I like much more than the superficial talks that the travellers routinely have. It is hilarious what ideas people hold or are told about another country that they have not personally experienced. For example, I had always thought that Americans were dumb and insufferable. Melody (from Bangkok) and Whitney helped me realise how wrong I have been to generalise the country&amp;rsquo;s people. A first generation American Indian friend of Whitney&amp;rsquo;s had told her a few things about India that I found ridiculous. One, that Patel was the most famous group of people in India (that guy was a Patel). And second, that Indians did not have pets because it was considered wrong to own a living being in India. I could not help but laugh at the second one. üòÇ I told Whitney that India is a patriarchy; we definitely own other living beings there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-day-of-adventures&#34;&gt;A Day of Adventures&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;break-down&#34;&gt;Break Down&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up and found Nils sitting with his friends (from Ning Binh) in the cafe. They had come earlier in the morning. Nils and I had plans to go to the Dark Cave and Paradise Cave today. He had graciously agreed to take me as a pillion. But it was only when we were out on the highway that he told me he was new to riding! Fortunately he was a good rider and I did not suffer the anxiety that I usually do while riding pillion with stupid riders. Other than a situation where a cow threatened to cause trouble for us, the ride till Phong Nha went pretty smooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had stopped at Phong Nha to get some bandages for Nils, but as soon as we started again, the fuel pump of his bike broke down and started leaking petrol all over the engine! I quickly cut off the fuel supply and then we went about looking for a mechanic. We found one close by who made a fortune off Nils by selling him a new pump and replacing the accelerator cable that he broke himself. I quarrelled a bit about the accelerator cable but the guy was quite dismissive of his fault. The fact that we did not understand each other&amp;rsquo;s language was not helping my cause and he worked himself into a fury. I conceded and Nils and I justified it by admitting that the cable would have broke soon anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hit the road again as quickly as we could but it was already mid day by then. We had decided to cancel Paradise Cave so it was just Dark Cave now. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t too far from Phong Nha and we got there in no time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;dark-cave&#34;&gt;Dark Cave&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We put the bike in the parking and got the tickets. This one cost us a whooping 450 kVND but that included a bunch of adventure activities as well. We quickly harnessed up and strapped on a life-jacket. Then we moved with a bunch of people to the zip-lining tower. There was an Israeli couple in front of us and Nils and the girls started a conversation. She was a hippie who lived in New York and seemed extremely zoned out. Maybe as a result of too many chemicals. Whitney and Paula also came along and we exchanged hi&amp;rsquo;s. They had taken a tour of the Paradise and Dark Cave that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Zip-line tower&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was eventually my turn and I zip-lined across the river to the landing pad on the other side. It was nothing too exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;VIDEO : Zip-lining&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were then supposed to wait for the rest of the people so I used the time jumping off a tree into the river. The leader of the group was an Irishman by the name of Jack. Nils, I and another guy completed the troupe. We did backflips and cannonballs in the river. I got winded on my first backflip and I am still not sure what caused it. Maybe it was the sudden temperature change; the water was somewhat cold!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My camera had lost battery after the zip-lining video and I was just foolishly carrying it around now. But I did test it in multiple circumstances and it is a tough one indeed! It took a couple of pictures of the Israeli couple who wanted me to mail it to them but never gave me their contact. So in case someone knows who they are, let them know! I just got a couple of pictures before the camera completely lost all battery.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Dark Cave&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once everyone had gathered around, we swam to the entrance of the cave which was just 20 meters off. Then we turned on the lights of the helmet and went inside the Dark Cave. There were no electric lighting here which lent it it&amp;rsquo;s name. This one was not as spectacular as the other caves but it was nice and huge and dark. We walked around in a line and entered a tunnel which kept getting narrower and muddier till we ended up in a pool of mud! This was the mud bath. We fooled around for a bit, splashing each other with mud and discovering that muddy water makes you extremely buoyant. It was difficult keeping your balance and you helplessly splashed about if you lost your footing! The bigger the group of friends that you come with, the more fun would it be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phong Nha Tip #1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go do Dark Cave with a big bunch of friends! It is much more fun that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got out of the mud bath and washed up before getting back into our life jackets (which we had dumped near the entrance of the tunnel). Then we were supposed to kayak to the other side of the river. Nils went ahead because I had stalled and found myself at the end of the line. I recognised one of the girls by her singsong English accent. We had met before in Ninh Binh and it so happened that she, her friend and I were the last three left to grab a kayak. All three of us were hopeless at it though. We paddled around pointlessly, turning into the wrong direction and making it to the other side in the most beelined fashion as was possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were some water activities on this side. A short &amp;ldquo;zip-line and jump into the water&amp;rdquo; thing and an obstacle course like thing made over the river. I tried them both. The obstacle course was tough and the river flowing underneath gave you the feeling of moving. I enjoyed all of it though. It was completely worth the money and the time spent. üëç&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-lost-the-keys&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;I Lost the Keys&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got out and dried ourselves before changing and getting the bike. We thought of going to a water spring that was supposedly just 2 kilometers away. I was not navigating on the map and we ended up missing it. We stopped on some hilly roads inside the Phong Nha National Park and get some photographs. These roads reminded me of Himachal for some reason. The mountains were much more rocky and covered with a consistent green foliage. It was really beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Nils the photographer!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ran into a truck on the narrow road and were unable to overtake it. So we stopped in a field at the side of the road to put some distance between us and the truck and to get some more pictures. We could see a structure up ahead but it was not clear what it was. Nils thought it was a house and I thought it was a big pile of straw. So we decided to go investigate. We got distracted by some buffaloes and a man walking in the field and started taking their photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, Nils realised that he had lost the bike&amp;rsquo;s keys! It was in his hand when he took out his camera and was mysteriously gone while he was clicking photographs. We spent the next thirty to forty minutes walking up and down the small area where the key could have been dropped. We parted shrubs and upturned garbage. Nils also checked his bag multiple times. It is really a wonder where the key went! Unable to find the key after multiple tries, we decided to push the bike till Phong Nha, which was another 40 minutes walk away, and try our luck there. It would be dark soon and there was no reason to hope that we&amp;rsquo;d find the keys now if we had not found it yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we pushed the bike, a few tourists who were with us at Dark Cave stopped on their bikes. One of them had a Win and we tried her key hoping it&amp;rsquo;d would work but it did not. They left with puzzled faces as to how we could have lost the key. We just smiled foolishly and waved them goodbye. I realised later that we could have done a bike tow! There were a few locals who offered us petrol thinking that might be the reason we were pushing the bike. Finally, a little before the Phong Nha town, a young man stopped and asked us what the matter was. He spoke good English and laughed when we told him that we had lost the key. He produced a pair of scissors and tried turning on the ignition using them. It worked! He was our hero for the day. We thanked the boy and jumped on the bike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a small break to grab some beer and noodle soup, Nils offered me to ride the rest of the way back to Dong Hoi. Of course I gladly accepted! It got dark on the way and the headlights came on. Ours was barely useful because it pointed left from the center. I slowed down and we got back to the hostel at a safe and easy pace. I washed up and watched the Italy vs Sweden match. It was a dull anticlimax to end the extremely exciting day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vietnam Tip #7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get a good bike if you are planning to do the Vietnam road trip. Most of the Win&amp;rsquo;s are uncomfortable pieces of shit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-expat-community&#34;&gt;The Expat Community&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was planning to take the day off and do nothing for a change. I had some breakfast and lay down on one of the hammocks to read a book. The book managed to make me drowsy and I fell asleep on the hammock. When I woke up, Michaella told me that Kevin and Beth had come around to see me and had been waiting for a while! These were friends of Aniket who had been living in Dong Hoi for about a year. Aniket had put me in touch with them and they had come around to see if I was around. Our introductions got weird at the part when they asked me how I knew Aniket. I had to explain how I was a &amp;ldquo;friend&amp;rdquo; of Aniket who had never met him!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note to self : meet &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14123807.Aniket_Ketkar&#34;&gt;Aniket&lt;/a&gt; some day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the next hour or so talking to them. They are amazing people taking a break from their corporate lives in America to volunteer in Vietnam. They teach children how to swim and Beth also takes yoga classes for people with disabilities and helps institutes to develop skills for resume building and preparing for interviews. They had left their established careers for this and it was quite an inspiring story. They had gotten married last August and they told me the beautiful story of the proposals. It was a nice hour long conversation which ended because they had plans to meet some friends. I was invited to join them for a party later that evening and Kevin also gave me some recommendations of restaurants in town that I intended to check out. Once they left, I returned to my hammock and fell asleep again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day quickly went by. All the inactivity was not exactly what I had imagined it to be and I was somewhat bored towards the evening. Whitney and Paula had left and Nils was missing (getting his bike fixed most probably). I wrote, drank beers and lay around in the hammock. Having had enough, I decided to go to town and started walking out of the hostel. An stopped me and offered me one of the free bicycles and I took him up on his offer. I rode to the city heading for one of the food joints Kevin had suggested. The town was all lit up, as if for Diwali. And it all seemed like a regular affair rather than preparation for an occasion. The bridge had an amusing moving light pattern. The beach area near the town was full of people. There were public parks and seafood joints. Dong Hoi was celebrating it&amp;rsquo;s evening in style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7713/28746955825_7572e1d804.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;dong-hoi-city-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Lit up Dong Hoi&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The place was a small establishment called &lt;strong&gt;Tu Quy&lt;/strong&gt;. It was quite busy and I sat down to share the table with a Vietnamese guy. He spoke a fair amount of English so we could get to know each other a bit. He lived in Hanoi and was in Dong Hoi for some work. I ordered some rice vermicelli and pork only to realise later, when the guy pointed out, that it was similar to &lt;em&gt;Bun Cha&lt;/em&gt;. This was &lt;em&gt;Bun Thit Nuong&lt;/em&gt;, a dish that was to become another of my favourites in Vietnam. My fellow diner had ordered the rice wrap which was similar to &lt;em&gt;Banh Xeo&lt;/em&gt; I had had in Ninh Binh. He offered me a neatly rolled wrap to taste. Even the shop owner let off 5 kVND from my bill because he did not have the exact change. How can you not love such people?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8787/28669546751_b28a9ceaf5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tu-quy&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Kevin eyes my first Bun Thit Nuong in Vietnam&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rode further into town instead of returning to Beachside immediately. I ran into a public square of sorts with a pretty fountain and something that looked like a historical structure. A coffee shop nearby was airing the football match on a projector and I ended up sitting for it and drinking a couple of coffees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I rode back to the hostel. With a kilometer to go, I realised that the rear tyre had gone flat and walked the rest of the way. Kevin had messaged me about the party that night. It was the opening party of a new hostel that was three doors down from Beachside. The new place, &lt;em&gt;Tiki&lt;/em&gt;, was weirdly similar to Beachside but still quite well done. People were quite drunk by the time I reached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat between James, Kevin&amp;rsquo;s friend and Daniel, a Dutch expat and enjoyed their short debate about American culture. Daniel said that America did not have a culture and James, an Asian American, said it did. Daniel said it was simply a melting pot. Daniel thought that even that was a culture of it&amp;rsquo;s own. It took me a while to adjust because of the difference in the level of alcohol in our bodies. üòú I eventually started participating in the conversations but by then people had started leaving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually it was just Daniel, Yeras (a Czech expat) and me who were sitting drinking beer and talking about random things. Daniel was 28, was working as an English teacher, had taken a Vietnamese wife and was father to two sons with a third on the way. He was happy and successful in Vietnam, much more than he had been at home and said that many that he knew were leaving Netherlands for places abroad to seek similar happiness. Life in Netherlands was tougher for them than it was out here. Yeras was 32 and was an English teacher himself. His problem was that he did not find the work challenging enough. The talks then took a more philosophical turn when Yeras asked the question : why cannot humans work together instead of fighting each other. It would take another dedicated post to expound on that idea but to put it in short, the night was extremely interesting. We drained the last keg of beer for all it was worth and left for our beds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;paradise&#34;&gt;Paradise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up early to catch the Copa semi final matches. Argentina trampled USA and Chile destroyed Mexico. The Copa matches were way better than the Euro ones in terms of the quality of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8686/28131640573_b8acf127d1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;cafe-sua-da&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Coffee and football make for a happy morning&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nils and I went back to Tu Quy for some breakfast. We had the rice wraps and I told him about the philosophical debates of the night before. We indulged in some early morning philosophising ourselves. Then we went to the local market to buy miscellaneous fruits that were taken back to the hostel to be blended into smoothies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nils was arranging for a visa run to extend his stay in Vietnam so I rented out a clutch-less bike from An and went back to Phong Nha. The bike was in a much better condition than the one I had ridden in Mandalay and my opinion of clutch-less bikes changed considerably by the end of the day. I took the HCM Road out of Dong Hoi and stuck to a speed of 60-70 kmph throughout. The sun was not harsh and this made the ride all the more enjoyable. I used my otherwise unemployed left hand to click some photos from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many more pictures of the HCM highway in the album at the end of the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rode past Phong Nha and on the road that we had taken back a couple of days ago after losing the keys. The road seemed longer today, probably because of my anxiety regarding the petrol. The indicator seemed to be dipping quickly and there would be no petrol pump to be found inside the national park area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Cow Crossing&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Beautiful green hills&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took the deviation for &lt;strong&gt;Paradise Cave&lt;/strong&gt; and parked my bike in the provided space. The attendant-cum-guard gave me an old ticket and when I complained that the ticket was a used one, as usual, he did not comprehend. I pointed at the number on the ticket so he just crossed it out and wrote the one from my bike. I shook my head and walked on. It was not worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched some commotion as I bought a bottle of water from one of the shops outside the complex. Some animal was being scared away and from the distance that everyone was keeping from where the creature was hiding, it was probably a dangerous one. I suspected snake but the thing ran away before I had a chance to see it. My questions to the locals were dismissed with a wave of the hand. I walked to the ticket counter and bought an entrance ticket for 250 kVND. Another 100k would have gotten me a buggy ride. I was not really going to pay that much for a pointless luxury. A 15 minute walk on a pretty and well-shaded trail brought me to where the buggy was dropping all the tourists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8368/28641767992_69d0efef14.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;paradise-3&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Buggy stop&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone anyway had to do the climb that followed. I was faster than most of the people and it took me a mere 15 minutes to do this as well. The humid weather was unbearable and I was hot and dripping by the time I reached the entrance of the cave. The air coming out of the cave was heavy, cool and damp; a welcome respite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paradise was &lt;strong&gt;HUGE&lt;/strong&gt;! I already knew what to expect from caves in terms of stalactites and stalagmites from the trip in the Phong Nha cave. Paradise had simply scaled everything up rather impressively. Plus one could walk in closer proximity to examine these works of natural art. There were huge pillars and extremely intricate and beautiful designs. Too bad that everyone had to stick to a defined path but that was the sanest thing to do. The grandness of the cave can only be experienced. It felt like some alien lair out of a sci-fi movie!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;The Alien Lair&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked till the end of the walkway and then rushed back to get away from a group with a Vietnamese guy smoking inside the cave despite all the signs that said otherwise. There are morons everywhere I guess. The closed cave made the smoke much thicker and the smell lingered on. I took a lot of pictures. There were all the usual unearthly designs and trees on rocks structures. There was a hut, a rabbit, a dragon and what not!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Rock formations at Paradise Cave&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was walking back, I noticed a white light that showed some white particles suspended in the air. This explained the heaviness of the air! I wondered if it affected asthmatic people. Anyhow, I spent a few minutes blowing it around and observing the beautiful diffraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went on a clicking frenzy in Paradise. Though the pictures do not really convey the beauty of the cave, there are more of them in the album at the end of the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked back up the stairs and out of the cave. I quickly hopped the steps back to the ground level and passed the people waiting for buggies. 15 minutes later I was at the parking putting my helmet on and watching a bunch of young foreigners teaching one of themselves ride a bike. I rode back the same route I had taken to get in. My mind was preoccupied with the depleting level of petrol. I quickly reached the HCM highway and immediately found a petrol pump. Sweet! I overfilled this time. My paranoia of cheating petrol pump staff caused the attendant here some pain as I troubled him about getting a proper look at the meter reading. But then, better safe than sorry. üòõ I rode back and crossed the turn for Phong Nha city. There were rice fields and river which I had not appreciated on the few times I had crossed the stretch before and I stopped to take pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Rice fields&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had noticed a sign that said &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pub with Cold Beer - 2 km&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; the first time I had crossed it when I was riding pillion with Nils two days ago. It had been on my mind and I turned around when I crossed the sign again. I checked the time and decided I had enough to quickly check the place out. It was still a little while to sundown and I really wanted to see this interesting sounding place. I took the turn into the narrow lane and the road turned into a dirt track after a hundred meters or so. I enjoyed the 2 kilometer long stretch that was well marked with boards leading to the pub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Off-roading to The Pub with Cold Beer&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took my bike into a modest looking complex but there was no one around and I was wondering if the place was open. I hello&amp;rsquo;ed a couple of times and a woman finally came out of the house and nodded to my question of whether the place was open. Then she pulled out a beer from the fridge and asked me to take a seat. The beer was &lt;strong&gt;cold&lt;/strong&gt; as promised! I also ordered a plate of rice and pork which came with some delicious peanut based gravy. I had no idea why this place was not on the radar and I did my bit by adding a &lt;a href=&#34;https://goo.gl/maps/MEdq5LabtcG2&#34;&gt;listing&lt;/a&gt; on Google Maps.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Kevin likes a cold beer after a long day!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I sat eating, two more scooters came in. The guys were Brent (Canadian) and Luke (from London). They had done Dark cave today and we talked for a bit. My skill of striking and keeping up random conversations was definitely improving. I needed to leave quickly though because I had to make my way back to Dong Hoi and I am not a big fan of driving after the headlights come on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phong Nha Tip #2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you go to &amp;ldquo;The Pub with Cold Beer&amp;rdquo; and make sure that you go there to spend a lazy day in the hammocks doing nothing but eating delicious food, drinking cold beer and playing a few games of pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made my way back to the HCM highway and turned in the direction of Dong Hoi. I took some pictures as the sun set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at Dong Hoi I hunted for a non existent DongA ATM because wikivoyage said it did not charge for withdrawals. I eventually ended up using another ATM that charged more than most of the others. I came back to the hostel and did some laundry. I had to skip the barbecue party because I was somewhat full with the food and beer I had had earlier in the evening. Then I sat and played mau-mau with Nils; it is basically UNO with cards. I also discovered that dragon fruit smoothies taste awful. Then Nils and I played a couple of games of chess on a rusted board before calling it a night. It was goodbye because Nils would leave for Laos early in the morning for his visa run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A South African guy walked up to me and was quick to identify me as an Indian. Apparently South Africa has the largest Indian community outside India. I did not know that. He had been teaching English in Cambodia and South Vietnam for a while. He had a few interesting stories to tell. There were two English girls who had come in late in the night as well. Mike, the American guy, was also there. We talked about a few things and the Vietnam war came up. He told me about a couple of people in Da Nang who had lived through the period and were willing to talk about their experiences if you visited their cafe. I was also quite surprised at how people like Mike who so very well understand that their government is screwing up affairs worldwide can just put the blame on the government. Democracy is what their country sells, is it not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;saying-goodbye&#34;&gt;Saying Goodbye&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just sat in Beachside all day long. Those guys pamper you to no end. When I told An that I was going to the town a little early to book my ticket, he took my passport on the pretext of making telephonic reservation and went out to book the ticket himself! When I told him he shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have, he just shrugged his shoulders and smiled. üòä So all I had to do was eat and read my book till it was time for the train.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Delicious food was all I needed to take care of!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mau, one of the staff, dropped me to the station on his bike. His home was right next to &amp;ldquo;The Pub with Cold Beer&amp;rdquo; and I told him I had gone there the previous day. He had been working at Beachside for 6 months now and had decent English. He was not much of a student in school but had fared pretty well since. I had to literally force the tip on him after he dropped me. Everyone in Beachside had been so nice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat down to wait in the station. When I got up to check the display for the train timings, a nice girl offered to help me out. She translated an announcement of delay for me and then helped me find the coach and the seat in the train. This was Bibi and she was travelling with her friend, Miss Han. Bibi&amp;rsquo;s English was good but Miss Han&amp;rsquo;s wasn&amp;rsquo;t all that great. However, it was Miss Han who was more willing to talk. She was a woman in her mid or late thirties and a &lt;em&gt;yogini&lt;/em&gt;. She also had a friend from Hyderabad. She showed me his video from a dance show he had done in Vietnam and then took a selfie with me! Later in the train, she offered me a mango as well and greeted me with a &lt;em&gt;namaste&lt;/em&gt;! üòÖ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The train was running a little late. The more railways I travel, the more I am in awe of &lt;em&gt;Indian Railways&lt;/em&gt;. Vietnam had just a single line in parts despite this being their main line. The route was not electrified and this was something I had seen in Thailand as well. The tickets are quite expensive and I am sure not if all can afford it. There is the air conditioning to justify the cost, but that makes it all the more a luxury rather than an affordable mode of travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a nap in the train. Bibi and Miss Han were getting off at Hue as well and Bibi came to remind me of the stop when our destination was due. I got off and followed them to the exit and thanked them profusely for all their help. They were taking a cab and would have surely offered to drop me had I not refused all further help. I was feeling a bit overwhelmed as it was.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>

&lt;p&gt;It seems like I had been planning a solo backpacking trip overseas for ages. In late May 2016, I finally took off for a trip through South East Asia like I had always wanted to. I was dismissive of all deterring arguments. I cared not what was happening to me or around me. This trip was all that mattered right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left Hanoi for Ninh Binh, a small town two hours south of the capital, best known for it&amp;rsquo;s remarkable limestone &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karst&#34;&gt;karst&lt;/a&gt; landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ninh-binh&#34;&gt;Ninh Binh&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bus dropped me 2 kilometers before the bus stop. They probably thought I wanted to go to Tam Coc, where most of the backpackers head. I was flustered but I had not yet mastered the art of conveying what I wanted to say in the lack of a common language. I would learn that later but for now, I was pushed out by the conductor with a reassuring smile that this was where I wanted to get off while I kept pointing straight ahead. Google Maps was not quick enough to load and I found myself looking at the back of the bus as I figured out I would have to walk for the next twenty minutes to get to the hostel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t so bad despite the sultry heat and the hostel turned out to be a really nice one. I knew that it was the renovated old station building and that explained why it was so generously spacious and airy. The dorm room was alright with all the required facilities. Good choice! I saw a rare member of the pedigree Indian traveller while I was checking in. As is customary, we refused to acknowledge each other&amp;rsquo;s existence and he was checking out of the hostel anyway so there was no need to fear a further interaction. Amusingly, we were introduced by a common friend on Facebook that very night! Sometimes you have to hand it over to the universe; it has an amazing sense of humour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7561/28349702692_b040caae4b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ninh-binh-roads-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Eerie empty roads of Ninh Binh&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was too late in the day to do any sightseeing so I decided to wander around. It seemed to me that the city had grown without sufficient reason. There were empty and wide roads all around. It looked like a hollow city. I walked up to the new railway station. It was in the middle of barren lands and seemed grander than it should have been. I walked in to find out how I could book a ticket to my next destination. It seemed a simple enough procedure, although I could not book a ticket then and there because I did not have my passport on me. There was a tout who was offering to sell me a ticket but I did not quite understand why anyone would use a tout for something so simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8809/28422271816_90c3b0f504.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ninh-binh-station&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Ninh Binh Railway Station&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wandered through the lanes of the empty city. The kids here were amazingly friendly. You encounter a &lt;em&gt;hello&lt;/em&gt; almost every time you cross a kid on the streets. There are usually more &lt;em&gt;hellos&lt;/em&gt; and a few questions that follow if you choose to reply and engage in a conversation of limited vocabulary. Some kids run away after hurling the &lt;em&gt;hello&lt;/em&gt; at you, so you wonder at times where it came from.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Just Kids!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the adults usually stare at you with a look of curiosity mixed with amusement. Probably trying to figure out where you are from and what you are doing in the narrow residential lanes of their town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not able to find interesting people in the hostel, I went walking once again in the evening. I first ate some delicious &lt;em&gt;banh xeo&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;nem lui&lt;/em&gt;. You are given a tray full of ingredients and are supposed to roll them up into a tasty snack. I came back for it once again on my last day in town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8802/28422275886_70efdbd16b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;banh-xeo-nem-lui&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Banh xeo with nem lui - Wrap and roll!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then walked to the north-east of the town where a green patch on Google Maps seemed like an interesting destination to look up. And it was! It was a big park full of locals who were starting to pour in for their evening walks and jogs. The ill maintained park had a mini-zoo and swings as well. Seemed like the recreational hub of the town. There were some elderly women standing in a line and giving a back massage to the one in front. I found it extremely amusing but despite their candidness, could not muster the confidence to stand and point a camera at them. I had still not gotten used to taking photographs of strangers. I just shot a video while passing them.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;VIDEO : Back Massage!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a staircase going up a rock at the end of the park. There was a small view point up there, a bust of some famous person, a shelter with Chinese roofs, a Vietnamese flag and the hammer and sickle of Socialism. I wandered around for a bit, looking at the interesting sights and people that the small rock had to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Pretty resting spot&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I walked back towards the hostel, an old man started talking to me. He asked me where I was from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;India.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He did not get me. &lt;em&gt;Spanish?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No. An Do.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He still did not get me but offered me a beer which I refused because of my experiences with over-friendly locals in Hanoi. I debated on how wise I had acted while I walked back to the hostel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vietnam Tip #6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could learn the Vietnamese name of your country to tell them to the locals. They almost always ask for your country and hearing it in their own language makes them happier! India is &lt;em&gt;An Do&lt;/em&gt; in Vietnamese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hostel was airing the Euro Cup matches and my nights here would be spent in the common area watching these matches, at times with interesting and other times with forgettable people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;karst-landscapes&#34;&gt;Karst Landscapes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day I rented a bicycle from the hostel. It was rather expensive, even for a mountain bike. It cost me 70 kVND while a motorbike was 100 kVND. However, I wanted to do something physical as I had been feeling sloppy of late so I chose the former.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two places around Ninh Binh that boast of the limestone karst landscape : &lt;strong&gt;Tam Coc&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Trang An&lt;/strong&gt;. Of these, Tang An is the less touristy one and a &lt;a href=&#34;http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/&#34;&gt;UNESCO world heritage&lt;/a&gt; site as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;trang-an&#34;&gt;Trang An&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rode towards Trang An in the relentless sun. It burned me despite the dark tan I had already acquired. The limestone rocks presented themselves a little out of Ninh Binh. They looked amazing; a rock standing abruptly in the middle of a plain. I actually had no idea what to expect from Trang An as I had left that bit in my research as a (hopefully pleasant) surprise. I also kept looking for a place that served local specialty &lt;em&gt;De Nui&lt;/em&gt; (mountain goat) but ended up not having it anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8687/28422288236_c5c4510a6b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;trang-an-road-karst&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Limestone rocks&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip #10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always leave a certain gap in your research in order to enjoy the place that you are visiting. For historical places, you might want to read up a bit but don&amp;rsquo;t see a hundred pictures of the landscapes you are about to visit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Trang An, I parked the bike by paying 15 kVND. This felt rather stupid because bicycles should be free or negligible to park. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why but it just seems wrong to charge bicycles and motorbikes the same amount! I also bought the traditional conical hat in my typical style of taking precautions &lt;strong&gt;after&lt;/strong&gt; I had been burnt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entry ticket cost me 150 kVND. It seemed somewhat steep at first but was more than justified later. It included the price of the boat that was to take me around. A boat can easily take 4 people so I had to wait a little before being adjusted with a Vietnamese family that spread out across three boats. They seemed rather reluctant to have me initially but gave me a seat to sit in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8631/28349733662_ae5724f6b5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;trang-an-boatride-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Boat trip with a Vietnamese family&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set out in the rowboat with the boatwoman rowing from behind and me and another guy helping out with single paddles from the front. Two ladies and a baby occupied the middle seat. Life jackets were provided but reluctantly enforced. The sun was harsh, the water was cool and the scenery was amazing. Our three boats stuck together as we rowed into the lake amongst the huge limestone rocks. Signs of civilization have been found in these rocks and there is an occasional structure looming here and there. We came upon a temple and the Vietnamese family talked to the boatwoman in their language. I had no idea what they exchanged but we ended up skipping the temple. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t complaining. I had seen enough of temples anyway. I was more interested in the natural sceneries of the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8694/28376055361_d76ac73887.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;trang-an-boatride-6&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Beautiful scenery at Trang An&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was expecting this to be the end of the trip and for us to turn around but we continued forward. I could not see a way ahead, just a big rock that we seemed to be heading straight at. Were we heading there for a swim? As we got closer, I could see a small gap under the rock, but it did not seem like a likely destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8137/28349741482_3868138c36.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;trang-an-boatride-9&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Heading into a rock&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got closer and the first boat did not slow down; it slipped right into the seemingly impossibly small gap! Our boat went in as well. These river tunnels were extremely exciting and amazing. The ceiling was mostly inches away from the head and at times you needed to duck to evade it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/140507143@N02/28454288005/in/album-72157671268456526/&#34; title=&#34;trang-an-tunnel&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8606/28454288005_d5c5158b34.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;281&#34; alt=&#34;trang-an-tunnel&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;VIDEO : Passing the tunnel&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of such tunnels but the first two were the best ones. They were the most natural while some of the others had been obviously cut up to aid the passage of boats. There was electric lighting to aid visibility as well. The boatwomen oared with practiced expertise. Almost all the boats were handled by women and this was quite a physically taxing task!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8269/28376061911_80f831e0f3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;trang-an-boatride-19&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Inside the river tunnels&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire experience got somewhat tedious after a while but that was probably because of the weather. The hot and humid climate made the stretches between the tunnels painful. The lack of a wind did not help either. We took breaks in the shade of the caves and skipped all the temples. The entire trip lasted two and a half hours and I just wonder how much longer would it have been had we stopped at the three temples on the way. The Vietnamese family had warmed up to my presence and offered me water and some snacks. I had come ill prepared because I was expecting the trip to be much shorter! There are shops set up in the temple complexes though, so one could stop there to pick up some nibbles and drinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boatwomen are extremely skilled. They can row the boat with their hands as well as their feet! They do it by themselves to rest their arms at times. But you can simply ask them for a demonstration and they might oblige.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many more pictures of the tunnels and Trang An in the album at the end of the post!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at the wharf I tipped our boatwoman an amount similar to what the family had given and sat to cool down. There were options for food and refreshment here but I was thinking of getting something from some place more local.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8621/28422304586_a0047bc1ec.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;trang-an-disturbing-statue&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Disturbing statues at the wharf&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I was rested, I went to get my bike. This was not entirely without complications. The parking attendant had changed and the new one was asking for money that I had already paid to the previous attendant. I tried explaining but she did not understand English. After much frustration, it was here that I realised the power of the &lt;strong&gt;Google Translate&lt;/strong&gt; app. I pulled out my phone, typed in what I wanted to say, translated it and handed it to her. She read it, smiled and let me out. It was really that simple!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip #11&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be frustrated at the lack of a common language. Technology makes things simple, use it. Many people can read their language despite not being able to understand your&amp;rsquo;s! Keep your phone charged and a translation app handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;bich-dong-pagoda&#34;&gt;Bich Dong Pagoda&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to go to Tam Coc next to check it out. I rode through the internal roads which were not as hot as the barren highways. The countryside was unspectacular for me though. It was a typical village and I have seen many of the kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tam Coc itself turned out to be very much a backpacker ghetto. I had initially thought of eating there but the burger joints and pizzerias made me change my mind. I pedalled on and reached the &lt;strong&gt;Bich Dong Pagoda&lt;/strong&gt; at the end of the Tam Coc road. There was a 10 kVND parking fee here as well! All this was ruffling me up. But the pagoda was nice enough to calm me down. There was no entrance fee for the pagoda itself, which, though expected, was a relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8710/28171823800_6c411ea2d3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bich-dong-entrance&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Entrance to Bich Dong Pagoda promised serenity&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked around the temple that I saw. A monk was cleaning the premises and we exchanged smiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8870/28349774052_72cb2c787f.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bich-dong-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Temple : Level 1&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just when I was thinking &amp;ldquo;Is this it?&amp;rdquo;, I saw a board pointing to a staircase. I went up to find another small temple. I just saw all these temples from the outside. I did not go into any of them, mostly because I was too tired to take off my shoes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8749/28171826450_69426b7640.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bich-dong-4&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Temple : Level 2&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a passage going behind it that I supposed went around the temple and I decided to take a round. The path was somewhat dark and I heard muffled steps coming from the other end before seeing a girl emerge out of the darkness. Upon getting closer, I saw that the path actually led to a staircase that went up into the dark. Alright. I climbed up to the sounds of bats. It was a friggin&amp;rsquo; cave! And it was &lt;strong&gt;dark&lt;/strong&gt;! A real bat cave! üòú&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg vertimg&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used the camera for some light since my phone was dead. The other side of the cave was another small temple and a path going further up. I climbed to a yet smaller temple up there.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Temple : Level 3&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Temple : Level 4&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A girl was sitting on the steps and I asked her whether this was the end of the levels. There was a stony path ahead but there was also a sign that said &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do not Climb Up&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. She shrugged and replied that a few friends of hers had gone up. I could hear and see two fellows up there. So I climbed up as well. The view was nice and there was a slight breeze. Was this it? They said two more of their friends were further up! This was where I finally went from &amp;ldquo;Amazing!&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;WTF!&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could hear voices and they came into sight soon. They were climbing down and I asked them what it was like up there. They told me its beautiful but also told me to be careful of the rocks since they were really sharp. I put the hat back and the camera and glasses in the bag and readied myself for the climb. This was the first real test for my new shoes. The mud disappeared soon enough and I seemed to be walking on rocks of weird shapes. After a day of marvelling at them from a distance, I was finally seeing a karst up close. It seemed like there were spikes and spines made in the rock. I climbed a little further using my hands to pull me through. Then I sat for a breather and saw the exhilarating scenery from above. The vast krast landscape looked beautiful from this height.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Karst scenery&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I climbed a bit further but then stopped when I realised that there was no one around nor was likely to be. In case of a problem I would, quite literally, find myself between a rock and a hard place. So I backed up and came down. I rode back to the hostel sweaty and happy at all the physical activity that I had gotten throughout the day. I rewarded myself by going to the town&amp;rsquo;s Jollibee later that night to satisfy my craving for a burger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8777/27838095054_76f4032995.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;jollibee&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Burger!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat watching the matches in the common room that night and met two Germans there, Ricardo and Nils. Ricardo had been to India and had lived in Auroville for 3 months. I asked him how the place worked since it had always been a mystery to me. But it turned out to be the same old money minded thing. He was a proper traveller who was big on couchsurfing and all in all a pretty cool guy. Nils was biking from Hanoi to Saigon and had the scars from a recent bike accident. I showed the guys pictures and videos from Trang An, recommending the place and then once Ricardo had left, I showed Nils pictures from my Ladakh trip. I try selling India at every opportunity I get!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;vietnamese-railway&#34;&gt;Vietnamese Railway&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up early for the Copa match. The unimpressive breakfast at the hostel was also expensive. Nils came around and we started talking again. I had told him about my plans to do the caves near Dong Hoi and he was interested as well. I told him that I was planning to go by train and told him how he could book his tickets using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.baolau.vn/&#34;&gt;baolau&lt;/a&gt;. But he got busy with a girl who was hitting on him so I let them be. Young love! üòÑ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked out of the hostel and dumped my bag in their storage room. I told Nils that I would be around since my train left late in the night. He was planning on going to Tam Coc so we would not have a chance to sync up till much later in the day. I went back to the railway station to book my ticket. The hat really helped! Despite the sun, I was at relative ease when I reached the station. There was no one at the counter though. I sat for a good 15-20 minutes before I decided to go out and seek some &lt;em&gt;Bun Cha&lt;/em&gt; which I had started craving somewhat. But there was no &lt;em&gt;Bun Cha&lt;/em&gt; to be found. In fact, there was no decent food option around which is rather surprising for a railway station. When I returned to the station, I found a lady at the counter and booked my ticket for Dong Hoi despite the rickety communication. We used a pen and a paper to explain ourselves to one another. I got a hard seat in the sleeper class, an upper berth which I actually prefer, for 369 kVND. It was considerably less than the price I had seen on baolau.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Communication skills&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came back to the hostel and sat working. Made some improvements in the blog. I was getting a hang of the front-end technologies. Then I decided to go walking around the town once again. I went to the &lt;em&gt;Cho&lt;/em&gt; (local market) and finally found the people of Ninh Binh! So this was where they all lived. My hostel and the railway station were in the outskirts of the town. The market had vegetables, meat, fruits, flowers, clothes, shoes and more; all available in whole sale! I walked around and returned with the satisfaction of having had found the people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Cho Ninh Binh&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While walking back, I ran into an alley which had been converted into a badminton court. There were men in their 60&amp;rsquo;s or so playing and I stopped to watch. I found their athleticism quite remarkable for their age. But they started looking at me a little uneasily, so I decided to stop hanging around in the shadows and leave them to their game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ricardo came around as I sat writing in the common room. We talked about his day and then he asked me if I played Chinese Chess. I did not know that there was a Chinese version of the game! Unfortunately we could not find it in the hostel so we had to leave it be. He told me about it and it sounded interesting (I am now trying to learn the game using an app on my phone). We sat to watch the ongoing football match and talked some more. He would have been one cool person to stay in touch with but he did not have any online accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nils&amp;rsquo; friend came up to me to give me his contact. He had gone out but had asked me to get in touch. I left him a message and then picked up my bag and made for the station around 10:15 PM. My train was at 11 in the night. I was hoping to find Nils there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roads were awfully quiet. I realised that it was the lack of noisy drunk men and barking street dogs that lent the streets this haunted silence. The sky was clouded but there was no wind, as usual. A veiled moon added to the spookiness of the night. I got to the station and sat waiting with a number of other Vietnamese people. No Nils though. The gates opened 5 minutes before the train was due. The people flocked on to the platform and waited for the train to arrive. It did so shortly afterwards and I walked up to my coach where an official checked my ticket and I was admitted inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8620/28349692212_010189e7d2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;platform-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Boarding the train&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cabins were like the first class category of India and I found my seat number printed outside one of them. The upper berth of the three tiered sleepers in Vietnam almost touches the ceiling! There was very little room for maneuvering oneself. The freezing air-conditioner had a vent right above my head and I had trouble falling asleep. I did sleep eventually but it was intermittently broken with the fear of missing my station. I kept checking my phone every hour to see if it was time for arrival at Dong Hoi. I finally got out of bed at 7 and sat down with the rest of the members of the compartment. Vendors came around to sell breakfast and water. Beautiful sceneries passed outside the window. Railways are so much better than taking buses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8688/28376306181_aaf9f08439.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;train-gallery&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Countryside train-scenery&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire arrangement seemed pretty nice. However, I did not quite understand why something so basic as the railways was made so luxurious and expensive. If they could remove the air-conditioning to slash down the rates would that not be more beneficial to the population in general? Everything in Vietnam was air-conditioned; buses, trains, taxis. I just don&amp;rsquo;t not get the need for it.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>

&lt;p&gt;It seems like I had been planning a solo backpacking trip overseas for ages. In late May 2016, I finally took off for a trip through South East Asia like I had always wanted to. I was dismissive of all deterring arguments. I cared not what was happening to me or around me. This trip was all that mattered right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a flight from Bangkok in Thailand to Hanoi in Vietnam; from one capital city to another, both strikingly different in their character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-eventful-arrival&#34;&gt;An Eventful Arrival&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I slept uneasily and was aware on a growing commotion around me. I finally opened my eyes around 3:30 AM and decided to try my luck at the check in counter. There was a huge crowd thronging the entrance at the baggage check. All of them were Asian tourists with big cartons and bags. I got in one of the many &amp;ldquo;lines&amp;rdquo; that was heading towards the X-Ray machine. People were quietly and patiently pushing at the back of my leg with their trolleys. I really did not want to get into an argument this early in the morning so I bore with the unpleasant pokes on my calves. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s not just Indians who are stupid tourists. I would have said they were Chinese, but I did not know for sure. To my relief, they were taking a chartered flight so they had a different counter after the baggage check. Phew!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/8/7400/27895141090_5c74c8e322.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;airport-jam&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Early morning crowding&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked up to my counter with fluttering heart. I was preparing my answers in my head. In case you are wondering what it was all about, I did not have a flight out of Vietnam and online forums said that some flights had this stupid policy. AirAsia had already asked me for a return flight when I was boarding for Bangkok from Chennai so in case they denied me admission here, I would have to buy a flight out of Vietnam then and there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The woman at the counter asked me for my visa. I showed her the invitation letter that would get me a visa on arrival. She went through it and proceeded to print the ticket. It was not until she tagged my luggage that I breathed a sigh of relief. But could it be this easy for me? There was one more hurdle awaiting at the Vietnamese immigration. But for now, I was through! I found a seat to sit in and charge my gadgets while I read a book. When it was close to boarding time, I walked to the allotted gate number and watched the sun rise over the Don Mueang Airport. There were quite a few tourists travelling to Hanoi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7486/27895143870_3ccd8e6425.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;sunrise-don-mueang&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Sunrise over Don Mueang&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vietnam Tip #1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AirAsia does not require an onward ticket for flights to Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flight was uneventful as usual. I tried sleeping but I could not because my neck hung at a weird angle. The flight was short though, so I was satisfied with just resting with my eyes closed. At the airport everyone streamed to the visa counters. The first line was to get the application form in exchange for a photo and your passport. A board proclaimed that you needed, among other requirements, an onward flight to get a visa. Damn it! Then I went to fill in the application anyway. There were no pens provided, you were supposed to have one of your own. Luckily, I did. The application started out well enough, then it started asking me weird details. Names, addresses and birth dates of family members! They had already taken my passport but I was also assumed to remember all it&amp;rsquo;s details. I had to connect to the internet to access the scanned copy and now the ISP wanted to know my age and salary bracket! I was in WTF mode by the time I was done with the application. I was not the only one, many others on the desk were looking around flustered hoping to find a relevant answer in a neighbouring form. I went to submit the application and it was nonchalantly accepted and I was asked to wait. Now I was frustrated as to why they were not looking at the information I had put in with so much effort. I felt so stupid!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The line I was standing in proved unnecessary. In Vietnam you are not served when it&amp;rsquo;s your turn. You are called when it&amp;rsquo;s your turn to be served. A screen above the counter displayed the name of the next person supposed to approach for the visa. Welcome to Communism! One of the girls immediately ahead of me ripped 50 dollars while opening the envelope in which she was carrying it. And that was all the money she was carrying. Her friend had some more but she was 2 USD short of what was required. I was wondering how stupid people can be when the lady at the visa counter gave her the passport and told her it was okay. She basically got into the country for free. My WTF mode jumped up a few notches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was asked to pay 25 dollars as the stamping fee, which I did without ripping any bills. I was handed the passport with the visa. I proceeded to the immigration desk. The lady officer was getting her make-up fixed by a friend and I had to wait a few seconds before they noticed me waiting at the yellow line. She took my passport and looked at me a few times more than necessary. I guess she was having trouble connecting my bearded face with the clean-shaven one in the passport. She stamped the passport and handed it back. I walked on. Was I in? This should be it, right? Yes it was! I was in Vietnam without incident. Woohoo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I collected my bags from the baggage belt, got a few dollars converted to Vietnamese Dong and got a SIM card. I had read about public buses stopping at the airport and was wondering where to get one. Route number 7 passed by without stopping but I was supposed to take route 17 anyway. There was a board which said there was a bus stop ahead but the number 17 had been scratched off it. Another bus approached and stopped right in front of me; &lt;strong&gt;route number 86&lt;/strong&gt;. There was just a western hippie girl getting in and I asked her if this bus would go to the &lt;strong&gt;Old Quarters&lt;/strong&gt;. She said it would. Perfect! I got in and took a seat. The ticket costed me 30k VND (roughly 90 INR) for a drop close enough to the hostel I had booked. This was a fairly new service which had started by the city. I observed the people in the bus as we travelled the 25 odd kilometers to the city. As a first impression, the Vietnamese looked very much like the &lt;em&gt;pahadis&lt;/em&gt; back home and the kids were extremely cute!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/8/7523/28097751141_b278a67fb8.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bus-86&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Bus #86&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hanoi Tip #1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnam has Uber. But unless you are tugging along a ridiculous amount of luggage, you could easily take route 86 to the city. It stops immediately to the right of the terminal exit gate and costs 30k VND flat for anywhere in the city. It stops around the Hoan Kiem Lake in the Old Quarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;old-quarters&#34;&gt;Old Quarters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was staying in the Old Quarters of the city. It took me the rest of the evening but I was able to figure out what about this place reminded me so much of India. It was the haphazard nature of things. Everything in this city was a random concoction thrown together; the traffic; the violations; the smells; the lighting; the garbage strewn streets; the people calling out to you; the flavours; the parked cars; the colors; the sounds. The buildings were stunted, something that I liked a lot. I slowly walked to the hostel, managing the notorious traffic of the city with relative ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that my hostel reception did was trying to sell me the Ha Long Bay tour. I was considering going to Ha Long Bay initially but now I was repelled by the idea. Too much hype. There was still some time to check in so I went to a restaurant nearby. I sat down and ordered some food. The first thing that the waiter got me was a glass of beer! And that is how I first had a &lt;strong&gt;Bia Hoi&lt;/strong&gt; experience! &lt;em&gt;Bia Hois&lt;/em&gt; are ubiquitous in the country. They are similar to the beer stations in Myanmar but serve you draught beer (&lt;strong&gt;fresh beer&lt;/strong&gt; as they call it) that can get you hammered in no time. I just had a glass though, and some food since I was starving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back to the hostel and checked in. The bed was pretty simple and basic. The facilities were clean. I had nothing to complain about other than the sales pitches by the reception and the lack of a socializing atmosphere. I got some USD exchanged at one of the banks and got a rate better than the airport. On the way back to the hostel, I got scammed by two women who were selling some sweets. I paid 100 kVND for something that must have been less than half the price. I was still getting my head around the massiveness of the numbers. The thousand is pretty redundant a figure in Vietnamese currency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hanoi Tip #2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beware of women forcing a seemingly sample savoury on you. In general, be extra alert around over friendly vendors in big cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vietnam Tip #2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ignore the thousand in VND. Think in terms of &lt;strong&gt;1000 VND or kVND&lt;/strong&gt; for quick conversions. 1 kVND is roughly 3 INR and 20-22 kVND is 1 USD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I caught up on some sleep and forced myself out of bed at 7 PM so as to not spoil my night. I went for a walk towards &lt;strong&gt;Hoan Kiem Lake&lt;/strong&gt;, a major attraction in Old Quarters. The lake was pretty and lit up with random lighting. There were people all around it, some walking, others running. The Vietnamese women are beautiful. If I had to compare, their beauty is much more &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; than the Thai. The Thai have an unreal dreamy touch to them. The Vietnamese beauty looks much more real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vietnam Tip #3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is usual to see topless men running in Vietnam. You get used to it in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Endless stream of bikes!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went till the Lenin Park next. It was further south. While I sat to rest and charge my camera, a man came and started talking to me with his limited English. The usual population of Vietnam does not have a very good English. There was the usual hello and question of nationality. I was also trying to learn some Vietnamese words on Google Translate app. I left after a bit and walked around to see more people walking, jogging and skating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Skating at Lenin Park&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked back to the hostel and had my first &lt;strong&gt;Pho Bo&lt;/strong&gt; on the way. It was super awesome! Food in Vietnam is not really cheap though. At least not for tourists. A single meal from street side places cost me in the vicinity of 100 INR. The rates might be different for locals though. Charging tourists extra is a perfectly acceptable practice in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;discovering-hanoi&#34;&gt;Discovering Hanoi&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I slept till 10 in the morning. The dorm room was nice that way; quiet and dark enough to sleep in; no rush or noisy dorm-mates. But the place is seriously lacking in atmosphere. It is ridiculously named a &amp;ldquo;party hostel&amp;rdquo;. I put on my clothes and went to the &lt;strong&gt;Bun Cha&lt;/strong&gt; place I had seen the last night. I sat in one of the two adjacent stops and was served with loads of food!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7588/27895180500_e2b47270d2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bun-cha&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Kevin hearts Bun Cha!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dish is simply &lt;strong&gt;WOW&lt;/strong&gt;. There is no adjective to describe this awesome food. It is one of the best mix of flavours that I have ever eaten. It is usually served with crab roll called &lt;strong&gt;nem cua be&lt;/strong&gt;. I was evidently overcharged though. That&amp;rsquo;s one of the problems with going to places without printed rates. I gained wisdom in exchange of 100 kVND.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vietnam Tip #4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are drawn to a place that seemingly has good food but no menus or printed rates, ask for the price before you order food. This saves you from unnecessary surprises and will help you get better deals even if you are evidently n00b. Also, there is no shame in fishing for a better rate, even in adjacent shops. Be shameless about saving your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked up to the Hoan Kiem Lake again. I went to the &lt;strong&gt;Ngoc Son Temple&lt;/strong&gt; built on one end of the lake. The ticket was reasonable and was the same for all visitors. The only difference in rates was for children and adults. It struck me as extremely unfitting, specially for a socialist country. Though I was benefitting from this, I still think that the country&amp;rsquo;s cultural heritage should be easily accessible to all sections of the country&amp;rsquo;s population. At 30 kVND, it was not really cheap enough for the poorer sections of society. I walked around the pretty temple. It was not very big and had a lot of Chinese looking designs. I took some pictures of people offering prayers and a kid troubling a sleeping cat. Vietnamese kids are really cute! üòÑ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting out, I sat on one of the many benches around the lake. A man came and sat next to me. His name was Lo. We talked for a bit about India, cars, bikes and their costs in the respective countries. Vietnam imports its vehicles and has a lot of taxes. Hence one comes across more motorcycles and scooters than cars. We talked about more random things but at the end of it I was not sure whether it was a genuine conversation or not because he pulled out a map from his pocket and offered to take me to see the museums on his bike. I said goodbye shortly afterwards and started walking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Parks and statues abound in Old Quarters&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked to the &lt;strong&gt;Temple of Literature&lt;/strong&gt;, Vietnam&amp;rsquo;s oldest university that had been turned into a temple for Confucius. The information brochure that I bought by paying extra at the ticket counter was a redundancy. There was no information in there but it served as a makeshift fan. üòú There was a lot of Chinese influence here as well and the temple itself was heavily decorated with idols inside. I enjoyed walking around the pretty complex with the green gardens and Chinese lanterns hanging in decoration. I went to see some impressive art work in one of the souvenir shops but did not buy anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came out after a while and walked till the &lt;strong&gt;Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum&lt;/strong&gt; which was a short distance away. That thing is grand and impressive! There is a giant flag of Vietnam flying in front of the building and the mausoleum itself is off limits to the public. A few soldiers stood attention at the gates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a museum nearby which I had initially thought of seeing but I dropped the plan because of the unending stream of sweat that I was producing. The heat was not much but the humidity was making things unbearable. I decided to walk back, there is always a tomorrow. There were more beautiful structures on the way but I just kept walking. No more sightseeing for the day. I ate a Doner Kebab from a stall which stuffed the meat inside a regular bread instead of pita but it was nice and filling enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7571/27895265630_6303656958.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;doner-kebab&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Doner Kebab&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at the hostel I washed up and sat downstairs sipping on a &lt;strong&gt;Hanoi Beer&lt;/strong&gt;. I wrote a bit and started drinking the free beer that the hostel was offering. It&amp;rsquo;s something of a norm in Hanoi for hostels to give free beer in the evening. The quality of the beer is suspect though. Two glasses of that made me lose all 3D perspective. I stayed away from those &amp;ldquo;fresh beer&amp;rdquo; kegs then on. Bottled beer was cheap enough. The hostel manager asked one of the guys sitting there to tell me what an amazing time he had had on the Ha Long Bay Tour. I was not taking a tour! Period. The guy was from London (West Ham) and had been to India for 3 weeks recently. It was his last day in Vietnam and he had not planned on his next country yet, which was weird since he planned to fly out. Richness!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked out to get something to eat. There was a place that served good &lt;em&gt;Pho&lt;/em&gt; near the hostel and I went to try it out. There was actually a queue to get your soup! I waited in the line and finally got a &lt;em&gt;Pho Bo&lt;/em&gt; for myself. It was not really much different from the one I had had in the simple shop the night before other than the amount of meat in it. Maybe my taste buds were not developed yet in the sense of differentiating between &lt;em&gt;Pho&lt;/em&gt; tastes. Anyway, I ate up and left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;The pho&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked up to another part of the town which was known for it&amp;rsquo;s night market. I had no idea what I was going to witness. I ran into the night life of the city. Literally every crossing was stuffed with &lt;em&gt;bia hois&lt;/em&gt; that overspilled into the street. There was usually a street performance going on as well in the middle of the crossing. Rock music, jazz, traditional Vietnamese music, electronic beats, etc. There was a lane dedicated to nightclubs. It was all completely unexpected for me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hanoi had seemed a very different city. An older man tapped on my shoulder and asked me where I was from. He was an American who lived in Vasant Vihar in Delhi. He worked for WHO. We talked for several minutes about India, racism, cricket and Tendulkar, etc. Then we shook hands and the conversation ended as abruptly as it had begun. A young boy offered me marijuana. I was unable to understand what he was saying initially because he did not look your typical drug peddler, but once I did, I laughed and waved him off.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;That&#39;s a traffic jam!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked around the entire area twice, clicking pictures and absorbing it all in. Then I returned to the hostel which had died as I had expected. I worked in the room for a bit and then went down to the reception to see the Euro match. There were two others who came to see the game, the West Ham guy and an Irishman who worked in the hostel. Around the 70th or 80th minute another guy joined us after his late night out. He was a Swede who lived in Yangon. We exchanged some Myanmar stories. He also expressed his surprise about a married Indian man he had met in a club who was trying to score with some Vietnamese girls. I could just smile apologetically in reply. We talked about random things for the remainder of the match and then went up to our respective rooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;couchsurfing&#34;&gt;Couchsurfing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got up late debating what I was to do today. I had not seen much of the city and was definitely not taking the Sapa or Ha Long Bay tour. I could go to Ha Long Bay by myself, or extend the stay in Hanoi by shifting into another hostel, or stay on here and deal with the pushy receptionist. After much mental tussle, I decided to damn it all and go to Ninh Binh. I still had time to make it to the station for the 1 o&amp;rsquo; clock train. I might get a ticket if I was lucky or would take a bus if I was not. Since I had time on my hands, I went to grab a &lt;strong&gt;Banh Mi&lt;/strong&gt; at one of the places that I had been recommended by Sodani. The &lt;em&gt;Banh Mi&lt;/em&gt; is a sandwich made in a French baguette bread. It was slightly dry for my taste but I was later to realise that Hanoi does not do the best &lt;em&gt;Banh Mis&lt;/em&gt; anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I had started walking back towards the railway station, I checked my phone for directions and found a message from Long. He had replied to my last night&amp;rsquo;s request on Couchsurfing. I am rather new to the community and barely have references to be considered but had tried my luck anyway. I stood in the shade of a tree and got in touch with him. A quick chat later, I was walking towards Hoan Kiem Lake to catch a bus to Linh Dam, the locality where Long stayed. I had no idea what to expect out of a host or what was expected of a surfer but I decided that this was as good as any time to find that out. A GPS and location fuck up meant that I had to walk an hour extra in the scorching sun and, flustered as I was, it was a respite to reach the apartment. Long&amp;rsquo;s flatmate, Tan, showed me in and then rushed out to give his exam. Long and Tan were university students. The apartment was a nice one with wooden desks and beds. It had the simplicity of a student&amp;rsquo;s house, something that I liked very much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a bath, exchanged a few words with Long and then dozed off for a couple of hours. I woke up later and went for a walk around the lake nearby. Long went to see his friends. We decided to sync up over messages since I did not have the house key and Tan was not back yet. The lake was a big one, though not really in the cleanest of conditions. The water level was somewhat low, perhaps awaiting the year&amp;rsquo;s rains. I did one complete circle around the lake. There were people playing pro level &lt;em&gt;jianzi&lt;/em&gt; and badminton, some were jogging (there were topless men again), and a little further people sat on small plastic chairs drinking sugarcane juice and looking at the lake. On the other side, there were people bathing their dogs and taking a swim in the lake. The water did not seem clean to me but they seemed to be having fun!. I saw a beautiful sunset with the sky lighting up in exquisite colours and being reflected in the lake.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Sunset&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat a while in a cafe waiting for Long to return. The first Euro match of the night was about to start so I sat there longer than I had intended to. Cafes are omnipresent in Vietnam and I had thought that would be expensive affairs but they were not! I drank a couple of coffees of different styles while watching the match. The Vietnamese coffee is strong and has a smooth chocolaty texture, very much like dark chocolate. I had a hot black one and a cold milk one which they call Ca Phe Sua Da. It is basically coffee mixed with some condensed milk and ice cubes put on it. This drink would go on to become my favourite beverage in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vietnam Tip #5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When in Vietnam, drink Vietnamese coffee!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tan was back by the time I returned to the apartment and Long was gone again. We talked a bit, about my travel in Vietnam and I tried to get some food recommendations out of him. Tan was trying to learn English properly. So was Long and the entire Couchsurfing thing was to that effect. I liked their enterprising spirit. They wanted to learn international languages and hosted tourists for that. English is supposedly taught in Vietnamese schools but it is apparently not good enough. There is a huge problem that the youngsters of the country are facing and a simple thing like lack of English speaking skills is robbing them of opportunity and international exposure. I wondered what I would have done had I been in their place; probably just sat on my ass and complained about the lack of facilities! We sat and talked some more later in the night over a late dinner. Long had returned by then. There was more of English and exchange of cultural information. Vietnam has a weird form of socialism. I had supposed that everything basic would be provided for by the government but it was not so. The students had a tough life here. We stayed up and watched the late night Euro match between England and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;temples-pagodas-and-uncle-ho-s-legacy&#34;&gt;Temples, Pagodas and Uncle Ho&amp;rsquo;s Legacy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wooden bed was not as uncomfortable as it had looked. I managed a good enough sleep but woke up early. I freshened up and had some breakfast with Tan. The student life in Vietnam is pretty unprivileged. I am not sure how the economics works but they don&amp;rsquo;t seem to have a lot. He told me about the dishes that are made for breakfast in Vietnam and how they don&amp;rsquo;t have them &amp;ldquo;because they are students&amp;rdquo;. Leftover from last night, if any, is what they have for breakfast. That was good enough for me as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After breakfast I decided to complete the pending sightseeing and went back to the Old Quarter in the bus. I got off at Hoan Kiem lake and walked towards the Mausoleum. It was lunch hours so I walked ahead to the &lt;strong&gt;West Lake&lt;/strong&gt;. There were a couple of temples marked on the map which I intended to check out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7716/28142106286_19606f49bf.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;west-lake&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;West lake&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first temple was &lt;strong&gt;Den Quan Thanh&lt;/strong&gt;. There was a small fee of 10 kVND to go in. The temple looked empty but for two women who were sitting on a bench. As I clicked photos, they came to me asking whether I wanted my photograph clicked with the temple. I did not. Then she asked me if I wanted to buy postcards from her. She pushed a few in my hands and I went through them for a few seconds saying that I would consider after seeing the temple. She got pushy now, saying that she needed to go for lunch so I should buy immediately. But I said I would skip in that case. She claimed that I must buy because I looked at the postcards. I laughed and handed it back. Then the other woman asked me to buy something for some baby which I cannot see. I was not amused. They went away with the look that said I had ruined their day. Of course I had. The temple was a nice and quiet one apart from this one pushy saleswoman. There were hardly any tourists around. The temple had a few spooky looking golden statues in red light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Spooky idols&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next temple, a little ahead was the &lt;strong&gt;Chua Tran Quoc&lt;/strong&gt;. This was supposedly the oldest temple in Vietnam; well maintained and renovated. There was no fee of admission though a board invited donations. There were lots of people here, tourists and locals. A catfight had broken out between two elderly women right outside the complex as I was passing by. It was mildly funny. There was a man standing at the main door and ruining the shot. He was in the same spot, working on his phone even when I came out. Inside there was an assortment of relics. There were inscriptions, beautiful bonsai sceneries, a 11 spired (I think that&amp;rsquo;s the count) tower with Buddha images inside, a Bodhi Tree gifted by Dr. Rajendra Prasad when he visited as the President of India. The main temple itself was small and similar to the last one. I spent a pleasant fifteen minutes looking around and walking in the complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;There is always an asshole spoiling the shot&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked back to the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum next. I came across the entry to the Presidential Palace and checked it out first. The was the house that Ho Chi Minh used to live in when he was the President of the state. It was a real palace. That man lived in style! I am not too sure how socialism works but here it just seemed like a mellowed down form of Feudalism. I walked around the pretty palatial complex and then exited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Uncle Ho&#39;s Palace. More in the album below.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up next was the museum. It was little more than the glorification of socialist values and their great leader. I was not expecting much else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7454/28142193416_9fdce989bd.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;hcm-museum-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;A temple of socialism&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was the legend of how Uncle Ho voyaged across the world and came to realise that socialism was the means to liberate his people from French colonialism and American capitalism. He made his way back to Vietnam and rid it of it&amp;rsquo;s oppressors. Some graphs of fudged numbers showed how socialism has worked wonders in consistently improving the economy and the people&amp;rsquo;s standard of living. The rest of it was a really quirky museum. There was a lot of modern art and some creepy looking things on display. I suppose Uncle Ho was a patron of arts, otherwise it would make little sense to make such a big museum full of it. I liked the air conditioning though and it helped me relax after the tiring day in the sun.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;VIDEO : Spooky!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked back to the Hoan Kiem Lake to find a lot of tourists around the bus stand. Just when I was wondering why the tourists were taking the bus, I saw that they were all headed to &lt;strong&gt;Lotus Opera&lt;/strong&gt;. It was time for the &lt;strong&gt;Water Puppet Show&lt;/strong&gt;. I debated whether to go for it but I was not in a condition to enjoy more touristy activities. A young man started talking to me at the bus stand. He was confused as to why I was standing at the bus stand. When I told him that I was waiting for the bus, he asked me whether I lived in Hanoi. The part where I was staying with Long was not one that tourists frequented. I tried explaining Couchsurfing to him but eventually gave up saying that it was like Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at the apartment, Long and Tan were not in but another friend of their&amp;rsquo;s opened the gate. There was another Couchsurfer (French guy) who had come in the meanwhile. I took a bath and had started writing when Tan&amp;rsquo;s friend came and started talking. He is an automobile parts dealer in Vietnam and wanted to know if he could import parts from India to sell them in Vietnam. I had no idea of the industry and his English was not good. We made use of a translation app on his phone to understand each other. The marvels of technology! I went back to the cafe nearby to see the Croatia and Turkey match. The coffee was so good! ‚òï&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modric ripped Turkey apart. By my counting, there were at least three of him playing on the field! Amazing. Then I went to eat some dinner on Tan&amp;rsquo;s recommendation. &lt;strong&gt;Banh Cuon Nong&lt;/strong&gt;. It was an amazing dish that might have been a delicacy in another part of the world. It was rolls made of thin rice sheets with stuffing inside. One was supposed to dip it in the sweet and sour sauce that was provided and eat it up. The dish costed me a mere 20 kVND.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7393/28097702931_c6aa71a03c.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;banh-cuon-nong&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Kevin eats Banh Cuon Nong. Do you?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dinner I went back up and chatted with another of Long&amp;rsquo;s friends. These guys invite their friends over to practice English with tourists. It&amp;rsquo;s a really nice arrangement. Long, his friend, the French guy (Rudy) and I went for some beer later. The weather was nice outside owing to sudden showers. We drank some super cheap beer and talked about the three countries : Vietnam, France and India. The topics ranged from weather and snow to population and number of children per generation. We sat a while and then returned to the apartment in hushed steps and voices. Bachelors and students are stigmatized everywhere I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;moving-on&#34;&gt;Moving On&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The French guy was gone by the time I woke up. I packed up as well. An Italian couple had just come in. They had been travelling overland from Italy for 10 months now. They intended to go to India in August and spend a couple of months there to end their trip. I find such stories so fascinating and impressive!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had another plate of &lt;em&gt;Banh Cuon Nong&lt;/em&gt; before catching a bus till &lt;strong&gt;Giap Bat Bus Station&lt;/strong&gt;. The touts jumped on me offering me tickets to Ninh Binh. I bought an extremely unauthentic looking ticket from one of them for the price that I had researched. One guy walked me to the bus and I took the last seat. Another man tried selling me lighters and bracelets. I just smiled and shook my head. The bus started and the journey was comfortable enough. They were playing &amp;ldquo;Ipman 2&amp;rdquo; on the TV. There was a strange Vietnamese voice over. A single person (a woman) had done it for all the characters in monotone. It was a good thing that I knew the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched the Vietnamese countryside for a bit. It is very similar to certain parts of India. There are the green fields with concrete structures peppered throughout. Tarred highways with fast cars racing on them. Billboards advertising things that aspired you to afford them. The only considerable difference seemed that the houses here had slanting roofs instead of flat tops back in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like I had been planning a solo backpacking trip overseas for ages. In late May 2016, I finally took off for a trip through South East Asia like I had always wanted to. I was dismissive of all deterring arguments. I cared not what was happening to me or around me. This trip was all that mattered right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is about when I got to Bangkok for my last few days in Thailand before leaving the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-capital-day&#34;&gt;A Capital Day&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The train to Bangkok was rather uneventful. It was much more crowded the the one I had took to Ayutthaya but given the time of the day, it was understandable. I sat in a seat flanked by Thai ladies of all ages and sizes and wondered about monarchy as a form of government. The Thai king is a ubiquitous figure; to be seen everywhere and mentioned everywhere. But it&amp;rsquo;s more of a puppet presidency of the &amp;ldquo;kingdom&amp;rdquo; because the government is actually in the hands of the military. Still, having an adored head of the state was something that lent everyone one common thing to identify with and unite under. Indians lack such a figure. We are as diverse in every single way as could possibly be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached &lt;strong&gt;Hua Lampong&lt;/strong&gt; and started walking towards the hostel. Google Maps showed a walking time of 50 minutes or so. I have tried to stick to walking for distances less than an hour away. The market that I crossed was mostly shut down. Sunday is the day off for wholesale merchants I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;The streets of Bangkok&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The streets had some impressive graffiti though. Bangkok promised to be be a city with character. But I am not much of a city person; I feel lost in a place so huge. I end up seeing just a small part of the city because I love diving into the back alleys and walking into the uncharted routes. You need to live in a city to know it and to learn to love it. Otherwise it is simply pointless.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;A tuk-tuk&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked into &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.glurbangkok.com/&#34;&gt;the hostel&lt;/a&gt; which seemed really nice. It was something of a boutique hostel with really awesome double beds per bunk. It was a steal for the money I was paying. I needed a nice place to stretch out after the ordeal in Ayutthaya. I needed to recover from the bed bug tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/8/7575/27313055554_541cd009d1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;glur-hostel-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Glur Hostel at Bangkok. Highly recommended!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a bath and decided to head out to eat something. I had not researched this area so I did not know of a lot of things here. There were a few street side shops that I had seen on the way and a McDonalds in the mall next doors. I wanted to eat a cheeseburger real bad so I walked into the McDonald&amp;rsquo;s. But while I was waiting for my turn, I suddenly felt like leaving the shop. It seemed a little unauthentic and while I had known it all along, the craving for a cheeseburger died as suddenly as it had cropped up. I left the McDonald&amp;rsquo;s and walked around in search of some good Thai food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While roaming the lanes, I landed in front of a place called &lt;strong&gt;Baan Padthai&lt;/strong&gt;. It was a pretty blue building and I must admit that it was the decor of the place that drew me in. I took a look at the menu and almost walked out. It was &lt;strong&gt;EXPENSIVE&lt;/strong&gt;! But curiosity had the better of me and I spent the next few minutes eating an excellent &lt;em&gt;pad thai&lt;/em&gt; that cost my an equivalent of 5 (if not more) meals. And that is how I first tasted Bangkok&amp;rsquo;s ubiquitous &lt;em&gt;pad thai&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/8/7281/27925217765_467a88ace0.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;expensive-padthai&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Super delicious but super expensive pad thai at Baan Padthai&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I later came to realise that the area where I was in had many excellent local shops which served Thai specialities. I had just happened to take the wrong turn and wandered in close proximity of ShangriLa Hotel. No wonder the prices were so!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the hostel I went and sat in the common room. There was just one girl sitting there gorging on &lt;em&gt;lichees&lt;/em&gt;. She asked me where I was from and this simple question started a conversation that lasted more than three hours. I cannot possibly recall the wide range of topics that we covered that evening. Travel stories are the usual norm with travellers; she told me about her impressive packing skills and thrift in buying clothes; we discussed food in our countries (she was from around California); there was a discussion about Spanish and pronunciations; how she was working 4 jobs to pay for this trip; how Uber drivers tended to fall in love with her; her broken relationship of past; my seemingly strange marriage of present; marriages in India in general; &lt;em&gt;lichees&lt;/em&gt; and pistachios in the fridge; vegetable markets in California, Mexico and India; progressive rock and Yes (the band). There were more topics I am sure but I do not remember them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the three hours she had filled herself up with &lt;em&gt;lichees&lt;/em&gt; and I got up to go eat some local food. It was only then that we exchanged names. Her name was Melody and she had a flight out that evening. We met again after I returned from eating a delicious bowl of duck noodle soup. She was on her way out to catch her flight. I bid her goodbye and sat back down to work on my laptop. There were three more people there now. The guy was playing the guitar; everything from Pink Floyd to Rodriego y Gabriela. I sat listening for a while and then went to bed to end the first amazing day in Bangkok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;wandering&#34;&gt;Wandering&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was sleeping much better in the new hostel. But I had to check out and check back in one this day. I had made two separate bookings because I decided to leave Ayutthaya so suddenly. So today I had to check out of the room and check back in two hours later at the appointed hour. I put my luggage in the common room and killed the two hours till the new check-in time by walking around the block. This was where everything was local. The food, the services. I came out on the main street and sat down in a famous roast duck place - &lt;strong&gt;Prachak&lt;/strong&gt;. An excellent plate of duck and rice and a plate of Sui Mai to be had at pocket friendly rates. I would definitely return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bangkok Tip #1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what part of Bangkok you are in, there will always be good local food to be had. A little research can give you many options in your range of budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had been looking for a tattoo parlour and had messaged one of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/ThaiBambooTattoo/&#34;&gt;studios&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook. The artist replied and I told him I would come around later that evening to discuss the design in person. There are some things that I still feel uncomfortable deciding completely online. I walked to the riverside jetty and crossed to the other side for 3 THB. Bangkok has excellent public transportation. There are the buses, metro and skytrain, river ferries and &lt;em&gt;tuk-tuks&lt;/em&gt;. For the more finicky, there are the taxis and Ubers as well. I, however, prefer walking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7316/27646659840_f88afa2bb8.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;river-ferry&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bangkok Tip #2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do try the public transport in Bangkok. The &lt;em&gt;tuk-tuks&lt;/em&gt; are fun but so are the ferries and buses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked to the studio and was received at the gate by Krit&amp;rsquo;s (the artist) wife. They had a small studio in a residential complex and currently were working with a client. I showed him the intended design, discussed it&amp;rsquo;s feasibility and booked an appointment for the next day. I went back to the hostel to take a break from the humid heat and to work on the app a bit. I waited till the sun had gone down before walking to &lt;strong&gt;Chinatown&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7387/27313039804_32b3f9c012.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;chinatown-4&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Welcome to Chinatown!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a certain point on the road when you suddenly come up against houses sporting Chinese lanterns on their porches; the boards are painted with Chinese characters all over; you know that you have entered Chinatown. I walked through nearly deserted roads in the residential areas to hit upon the famous &lt;strong&gt;Yarowan Road&lt;/strong&gt;. Chinese temples welcomed me to this bustling kilometer long street that had all the tourist activity. The roads suddenly became jam packed and the crossings were saturated with the smell of barbecue fishes and shouts of noisy vendors. I struggled to make my way through the human traffic jamming the pedestrian walkways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/140507143@N02/27646548250/in/album-72157667534472363/&#34; title=&#34;chinatown&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/8/7248/27646548250_fb69c90781.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;281&#34; alt=&#34;chinatown&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Sights and sounds of Chinatown&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a few dishes I would have loved to try but they were exceeding my budget by a stretch! Maybe some other time. I settled for a less gaudy stall and had a fish ball noodle soup and a glass of pineapple juice. Plain, simple and filling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/8/7733/27890806426_cab3c66a0c.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;fish-ball-noodle-soup&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Noodle soup is always an efficient meal&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to walk till the legendary &lt;strong&gt;Khaosan Road (KSR)&lt;/strong&gt;. The roads suddenly turned uncomfortably deserted after Chinatown. The streetlights were bleak at best, the shops had their shutters down and the rare car&amp;rsquo;s headlight blinded my field of vision. Bangkok has some dangerous stories associated with it and I walked with a fluttering feeling in my stomach despite the watch telling me it was just 8:30 PM. I dropped the idea of walking till KSR and thought that I would take the jetty there instead. It was close by and I could see the &lt;strong&gt;Grand Palace&lt;/strong&gt; on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The buildings changed in size and shape as I approached the Grand Palace. They were much more spread out and had the luxury of horizontal space. I fell in love with the low light shooting capacity of my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.getolympus.com/us/en/tg-870.html&#34;&gt;new camera&lt;/a&gt; and clicked innumerable pictures of the lit up Grand Palace. The &lt;strong&gt;Ministry of Defense&lt;/strong&gt;, quite unsurprisingly, had it&amp;rsquo;s building right opposite to the palace.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Grand Palace and MoD&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked around the walls of the palace and found the people of Bangkok. They had shut shop and were taking time for themselves. The parks were full of people walking, jogging, sitting, cycling or playing badminton; even table tennis! Men sat drinking in small shops and discussing their day with their friends. Yes, there were a lot of people. They were just not working at 9 PM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7177/27646625560_cf76e1e9d6.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;grand-palace-10&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;People enjoying their evening in the park&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The jetty had closed down as well. I debated going to KSR and taking a &lt;em&gt;tuk-tuk&lt;/em&gt; back. But then I thought I would leave something for my return to Bangkok. Despite tired legs, I decided to walk back to the closest BTS station that was almost 5 kilometers away and then travel the remaining distance by the skytrain. I started walking slowly, taking a different and more direct route than what I had taken to get here. I hit upon an unexpected night market. It seemed similar to &lt;em&gt;mandis&lt;/em&gt; back home. Vegetables, fruits and flowers were being sold in wholesale quantities all along the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7682/27312029963_9bd63da73e.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;night-market-1&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Scenes from the night market&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went up to the &lt;strong&gt;Chao Phraya&lt;/strong&gt; river and saw lit up boats making their way across a lit up iron bridge. The city was &lt;strong&gt;definitely&lt;/strong&gt; not dead yet. Of course there were the poor and dejected in this city like in any other; they could be found dwelling under the bridges and in abject unlit corners of unclaimed plots. But the underbelly of Bangkok is not half as bad as some of the Indian cities. Delhi or Mumbai are not even valid choices for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7202/27313000534_077a22ecd1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;river&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Lit up river&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked with impunity now; through alleys and deserted shortcuts. I stopped at a &lt;strong&gt;Seven Eleven&lt;/strong&gt; to cool down when I wanted a respite from the humidity. Eventually, I reached the BTS station and took a train to the station next to my hostel. I rested my limbs, wrote and went to sleep a little late despite the tiring day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7742/27925163175_9c4c0bc0db.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;taking-deserted-shortcuts&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;football-ink&#34;&gt;Football &amp;amp; Ink&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the late night, the alarm woke me up early. I freshened up quickly and left to take the BTS to Sukhumvit. There was a sports bar there that would be open at 8 in the morning. I was going to catch the Argentina and Chile Copa match. This was the first of many sleep deprived days that would result because of my sudden unexplainable football frenzy. But it has been worth it so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BTS was full of people in office commute. I missed a couple of trains before I got into one. People were packing up the coaches to its capacity but they were not forcing themselves in. The luxuries of less population!The coach that I eventually managed to get in was full of people with centimeters of personal space to spare. It was completely packed but there was absolutely no noise. No loud music blaring out of loudspeakers, no chattering school kids, no &lt;em&gt;jaats&lt;/em&gt; boasting about their escapades with women or in fights. People talked in hushed tones when they had to and picked their phones almost apologetically. The loudest sound was an occasional clearing of throat. It seemed extremely unnatural to have so many people and such a dearth of sound. People got off at their stops like clockwork and headed for the exit or exchange. I joined the crowd changing lines at Siam and taking the Sukhumvit line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/140507143@N02/27312950394/in/album-72157667534472363/&#34; title=&#34;silence&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/8/7407/27312950394_da3f96aba3.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;281&#34; alt=&#34;silence&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Weird silence&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was at he sports bar a little after 9. The Copa match was not being shown on any of the screens and there were a handful of people in there. This meant I was the only person who was here to watch the match. Might have just as well streamed it in the hostel. The staff put on the match and I settled down to watch the good game with beer for breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/8/7427/27311982693_df432c7148.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;beer-football&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Beer and football&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next screen had the NHL on. My eyes drifted to see that match ever so often. Ice hockey is a very fluent but violent game. This got me wondering that almost all the &amp;ldquo;American&amp;rdquo; games are similarly violent - Ice Hockey, American Football, Baseball. While some countries have compulsory military service, is this the American way to make their children fit and keep them ready for wars? Anyway, this explained the few people in the bar that early in the morning. It was some Stanley Cup which is a big deal in North America. The person sitting next to me, Mike, was also watching the same. He was a Canadian and we got talking for a bit. The game ended with Argentina winning 2-1 and Di Maria scoring. &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was full of one and a half liters of beer and I wanted to leak some out but I thought I would use the bathrooms at the BTS. But there was no bathroom at the BTS! In fact, there was none all the way till Krit&amp;rsquo;s studio. I wonder what people in Bangkok do when they have to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Krit at work&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Krit showed me the design that he had made out of the rough sketch I had given him the last day. It had taken the essence out of my design. It is really tough to get a tattoo when you can sketch yourself and have a design in your head. After almost an hour of iterations, the design had come to almost 75% of what I wanted but Krit was having difficulties understanding the nuances that I was suggesting. The language barrier wasn&amp;rsquo;t helping much either. I got it to a state which I could work on later and finalized it. Meanwhile, two German girls had walked in and were waiting for me to end the charade so that they could get their tattoos. One of them (Alina) wanted a simple tattoo and the other (Sandra) wanted a tattoo but was not sure of the design. She changed her mind before I got mine and changed it again after Alina got hers but then the rest of us told her to change it again so that she does not get one in haste. üòù&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;A confused Sandra&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got the tattoo done in the traditional Thai bamboo style. It was much more painful than my last one but that was probably because of the part of the body I was getting it on. I was getting it in a spot with very little flesh to work with so the needle hit the bones quite often making the pain unbearable occasionally. Bamboo tattoos are the same as gun tattoos. It is just a slower process that involves more effort for the artist and also gives him a bit more flexibility. After almost 30-40 minutes of non stop work the tattoo was completed. I checked it in the mirror, gave Krit a thumbs up and accepted my new tattoo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;The tattoo. It&#39;s a turtle just so you know!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to wait till Alina got her tattoo to see how the bamboo tattoo is actually done. Her&amp;rsquo;s was done in two minutes and was more or less painless. :P We clicked some pictures and the girls invited me to some Moon Bar where they were heading to later in the evening. This was one of those bars which required a dress code and neither did I have the clothes nor the money to splurge on expensive drinks. I walked back to the hostel and ate some fried noodles on the way near the jetty. I was slowly realising that I had chosen a really bad spot for the tattoo. Maintaining it would be difficult with the backpack strap pressing against it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-famous-nightlife&#34;&gt;(In)Famous Nightlife&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lazed around in the hostel for the rest of the day and finally decided to head out towards the evening. I thought of Khaosan Road but when I got out, I came to know that it was raining quite hard. The ever-smiling girls at the receptionist asked me if I was checking out tomorrow. I was, otherwise the owner of the hostel was throwing a party that he was inviting everyone to. There would be a free beer as well. This was the second time in the day that I was being invited to a party that I could not join! And of late I had been thinking of how nice it would be to have someone to go and party with once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Heavy downpour&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked out as the rain slowed to a drizzle and ran the last few meters to the BTS when the drizzle picked up into a heavy rain again. There was no way I was going to KSR in this rain. I decided to go back to Sukhumvit instead. The BTS was crowded with dressed up people this time. The nightlife of Bangkok was stirring alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Living the night&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got off at the station closest to &lt;strong&gt;Nana Plaza&lt;/strong&gt;. This was one of the known hubs for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;gogo&lt;/em&gt; bars&lt;/strong&gt; in town. I had nothing particular in mind. I thought I might sit down at some place that advertised cheap drinks. I walked around the Plaza observing the proceedings of the evening. The customers were mostly men of advancing ages, in their 60&amp;rsquo;s or more. I personally felt like this was a genuine market. If you can keep your morality aside for a minute, there is no reason why one should not spend his or her money to get intimate with another human being. Maybe one no longer has the ability, opportunity or the inclination to have a meaningful relationship anymore. And if someone is selling his/her body, then it means that this is the best way they have found to feed themselves. Of course there is the problem of human trafficking but it is a separate problem altogether. Forcing someone to do something against their will is plain wrong, no matter what trade it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/8/7673/27312982474_744d6a7f36.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;nana-plaza-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Nana Plaza&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I was not standing in judgement. I had no right to judge anyone. I just walked around the complex taking mental notes, smiling and refusing the invitations. Many of the bars had interesting themes to them appealing to the more popular fetishes. As always, it is toughest to cross the bars that feature lady boys. They are the most insistent ones and will often touch you in inappropriate manner. But a smile and polite no is usually enough for them to leave you alone, if not immediately then within a few seconds. I clicked some pictures and walked out of the complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Den of debauchery&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip #9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never freak out if you are hustled. Stay calm and say your &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; with determination. No one is going forcing you to anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I headed to &lt;strong&gt;Soi 8 and 11&lt;/strong&gt; next. These were the alleys with &amp;ldquo;cleaner&amp;rdquo; nightlife. I must have passed a gazillion Indians all around. My ears picked up Hindi, Bihari, Punjabi and some South Indian languages. There was even a &lt;em&gt;dosa&lt;/em&gt; shop at the entrance of one of the Sois.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7339/27848026451_0532c5ea0e.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;city-lights-3&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Bustling Sois&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Older &lt;em&gt;firang&lt;/em&gt; men walking with their young Thai &amp;ldquo;girlfriends&amp;rdquo; was a common sight. I was looking for a place to chill and drink a couple of beers but nothing really appealed. Soi 8 had ended quickly and Soi 11 was really nice with lots of bars. There was even one with live music. But none called out to me so I kept moving. Girls lined the streets asking if the passer-bys wanted a &amp;ldquo;massage&amp;rdquo;. I kept walking. Next stop, Soi Cowboy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7641/27848023041_bce8a4c011.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;soi-cowboy-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Soi Cowboy&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soi Cowboy&lt;/strong&gt; is similar to Nana Plaza. The neons were bright and glaring. The small alley was packed with tourists; some curious onlookers and some active part of the debauchery. Skimpily dressed girls invited people in for drinks and more. Street carts served for cheap bars for those who wanted a quick fix. A man was trying to sell me a &amp;ldquo;Rolex&amp;rdquo;. No food or drink options of my type and all this walking was making me sweaty. This was not good for the tattoo so I caught the BTS and headed back to the hostel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grabbed dinner at one of the shops at the corner of the food block. Decent &lt;em&gt;pad thai&lt;/em&gt; for a decent cost. Then I made good on my promise for a beer and picked up a &lt;em&gt;Tiger&lt;/em&gt; from the nearby Seven Eleven. I sat on the street drinking it and then returned to the room to dry myself and nurse the tattoo. So much for the Bangkok nightlife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;au-revoir-thailand&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Au revoir&lt;/em&gt;, Thailand&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not get out of the bed till 11 in the morning. I freshened up and packed my bags. The great thing about hostels is that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to keep a room to stay in the hostel. You can just hang out in the common room all day. It is only if you need to spend the night that you need to pay for the bed. I was going to spend my night in the airport because I did not want to take a taxi at 3 AM in the morning. So I checked out, grabbed some breakfast and left my bags in the common room. Then I went around to get some visa photos clicked and got the required print outs for the Vietnam visa. I also got to play with a basket full of rabbits that were up for sale. üòÜ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Furballs!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to use the day to complete the &lt;a href=&#34;http://grasskode.xyz/post/travel/sea-thailand-kohtao&#34;&gt;Koh Tao blog post&lt;/a&gt;. The only time I went out of the hostel was to grab some food at Prachak. I even ventured to cross the river to find a cafe to work in but quickly returned to the comfort of the hostel and worked on the blog again. I was almost done when the clock said it was 8 in the evening. I did not want to miss the train to &lt;strong&gt;Don Muang&lt;/strong&gt;. So I put on my bags, taking care that the tattoo was safe and walked to the BTS station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A series of BTS and MTS trains got me to Hua Lampong. The MTS is weirdly similar to Delhi Metro, probably the same company who helped us set it up. I got a 20 THB ticket in an express train from Hua Lampong to Don Muang. Then I used the 40 minutes till the departure of the train to grab something to eat in one of the shops outside the station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bangkok Tip #3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cabs in Bangkok are cheap. But still, if you want to save a couple of dollars there is always a way to do it. There is no dearth of good public transport in Bangkok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The train was a different sort with automatic doors. It also ran faster and therefore got me to &lt;strong&gt;Don Muang&lt;/strong&gt; earlier than I had expected. I tried doing a mobile check in on the AirAsia app but it did not work. The message said that I needed to go to the counter to get my documents verified. I had been looking all over the internet to find out whether I would need an onward ticket from Vietnam to get entry into the country. The forums said that although the immigration did not really require a ticket usually, some airlines often had such irksome policies. AirAsia had already asked me for my return tickets when I was taking the flight from Chennai to Bangkok. I started imagining conversations in my head where I was being asked for an onward ticket that I did not have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me ten minutes to walk from the railway station to the International terminal. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why this way of travelling is not more popular. It cost me a total of less than 70 THB and was mostly a pleasant journey. The airport officials told me that the check-in for the Hanoi flight would start at 3 AM so there were still 4 hours to kill. I used the Bangkok Airport WiFi to finish my blog and got a couple of hours of shut-eye lying down on uncomfortable chairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like I had been planning a solo backpacking trip overseas for ages. In late May 2016, I finally took off for a trip through South East Asia like I had always wanted to. I was dismissive of all deterring arguments. I cared not what was happening to me or around me. This trip was all that mattered right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is about when I got to Ayutthaya, a small town 80 kilometers north of Bangkok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reaching-ayutthaya&#34;&gt;Reaching Ayutthaya&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bus reached Bangkok at 5:30 AM just as promised. I was somewhat relieved that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t earlier than expected as we had consistently experienced in Myanmar. It is no fun to catch an overnight bus that drops you off in the middle of the night. Bangkok was humid and the wet roads spoke of recent showers. The sun had crossed the horizon but was struggling to break free of the clouds that cluttered all around it. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t complaining. I walked up to the bus stand that was supposed to get me a bus till Hua Lampong Railway Station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7563/27651267225_4819fd7e95.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bangkok-cloudy&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Overcast Bangkok&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city was more active than I had expected it to be at 6 in the morning. People were going to their offices and taxis zoomed past with passengers going from somewhere I did not know to some place I did not care. What time did the offices start in Bangkok? 7 AM? I waited 10 minutes for the bus but the route number that I was waiting for (159) did not make an appearance. I decided that I would prefer walking to sitting around in the humidity. At least that way I had a fixed estimate of reaching the station. I started walking towards the Railway Station, passing through the streets of Bangkok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7268/27373133470_eea8fa8361.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bangkok-streets-4&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Early morning activity in Bangkok&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me 40 minutes to reach the station and I was sweating like a pig by that time. I went up to the ticket counter and was greeted by a well disposed officer. He smiled and I smiled back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(O - Officer, M - Me)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O : &lt;em&gt;Sawasdee Krab.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M : &lt;em&gt;Sawasdee Krab.&lt;/em&gt; Ticket to Ayutthaya. Next train.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O : Okay. &lt;strong&gt;types something on his keyboard and shows me the screen&lt;/strong&gt; 20 Baht.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M : Okay. &lt;strong&gt;handing him the money&lt;/strong&gt; What time is the train?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O : 7 o&amp;rsquo; clock. Platform 9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M : &lt;em&gt;Khob Khun Krab.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wait. 7 o&amp;rsquo; clock? I looked at my watch. 6:58.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M : Train at 7?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O : &lt;strong&gt;smiling&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Platform number 9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck! I picked my bags and ran to the platform. Fortunately it was the first platform I hit after the counter. I could see the train standing at a distance. The first coach was 2nd class. No. I ran on to the next coach. 3rd class. Yes. I jumped in and breathed a sigh of relief. I adjusted my luggage and checked my watch. 7:00. But the train did not start till 7:06. I felt a little stupid but it was alright I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Hua Lampong Station&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This train only had a few people scattered about on the seats randomly. The trains coming into Bangkok were jam packed though. That time of the day. The train slowly made it&amp;rsquo;s way through Bangkok. There were frequent stops at stations or otherwise. There was a wind through the window every time the train moved and it helped me drift off to sleep. After Don Muang, the train ran at a consistent pace and we were in Ayutthaya by 8:35 AM. I was not up to walking the three odd kilometers to the hostel so I entertained a &lt;em&gt;tuk-tuk&lt;/em&gt; driver who took me to the hostel for 80 THB. Ayutthaya seemed like a pretty laid back place from the back seat of the &lt;em&gt;tuk-tuk&lt;/em&gt;. It had wide roads at right angles and not too many people or vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hostel was probably the coolest one I have been to yet. There was a lot of random stuff all around and the decor was something of a chic - antique setting (to borrow the term from one of the reviews I had read). The check in time was at 1 PM but I was offered a place to put away my luggage and the common bathroom to freshen up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat a while in the hostel and then left to wander as usual. I made a rough plan on a map and then disregarded it, as always. I walked past the museum and the temples. I was in no mood to pay and watch something so redundant. Dao had already given me an idea of what to expect. Golden Buddhas sitting inside gaudy temples. No thank you! I walked along the riverside till I reached a market. I went into the market and examined the produce on sale. Fresh fishes, barbecued ones, sandals, vegetables, etc. I got out from the opposite end. People looked at me with curiosity and were quick to smile when I caught their gaze. I was already liking Ayutthaya. There were few people, fewer tourists and the locals were warm and welcoming.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Scenes from the market&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I wandered around, I started thinking why people did not wander much. It is so much fun to explore the unknown lanes of a new place. There are unexpected relics, waving children, barking dogs, exquisite food and what not! I never quite understand the fun people find in sticking to the &amp;ldquo;tourist area&amp;rdquo;. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a sense of familiarity and convenience that keeps them there.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Wandering around Ayutthaya&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I picked up some charcoal grilled chicken (&lt;em&gt;kai tod&lt;/em&gt;) and ate it with relish as I walked back to the hostel. Even the food was cheap here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEA Tip #4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Northern Thailand is cheaper than Southern Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back to the hostel and checked in. My bed was not quite ready so I sat in the common room listening to blues and jazz play on JBL speakers. I sat reading the book a while and then took the map and headed out again. This time I went in the direction of the main temples but I was still not in the mood to pay for my entrance. The sun was out and the weather had become hotter. I walked around the temples and saw some beautiful green stretches between them. This city gave me a feel of Anuradhapura. There were beautiful parks and the temples were not crowded together like it was in Bagan. I was half expecting this place to be like Bagan by the way, but thankfully it wasn&amp;rsquo;t. The temples had low walls so despite not paying the fee, I was able to see most of them by just walking around them. They were quite beautiful and oozing with history, but it was the parks that I really fell in love with. They had these small ponds and lakes and lots of birds. I felt like going for a run which I planned on doing every single morning but those plans were never executed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ayutthaya&amp;rsquo;s main city is full of &lt;em&gt;wats&lt;/em&gt; (temples) and the region is quite well preserved. No new buildings encroach the land and the city has spread out far from these relics. The Buddhas in the &lt;em&gt;wats&lt;/em&gt; curiously have their heads cut. Apparently these heads were cut off and sold to private collectors in the western market. The temples are a curious mix of Hindu and Buddhist structures. There are the bell shaped pagodas and the phallic &lt;em&gt;shikhars&lt;/em&gt; of temples to be seen together in the same complex. It reminded me of a recent article that I had read about the spread of Indian culture in south-east Asia. Even the name Ayutthaya is derived from the capital of Ram Rajya : Ayodhya.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Wat Ratburana&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I returned to the hostel to take a bath and do some laundry. I have discovered that regular laundry helps me get through the task faster and easier than making a pile and dealing with it all at once. Also, I have been slowly growing appalled at my bag&amp;rsquo;s contents. I used to be somewhat proud of my packing skills. No more. I ended up leaving my sandals and slippers in this hostel. No point carrying them around if I am not going to use it. The new &amp;ldquo;Aquashoes&amp;rdquo; that I had picked up seemed to be doing really well. I will be dropping more stuff further in the trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;creepy-crawlies&#34;&gt;Creepy Crawlies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran into a traveller&amp;rsquo;s nightmare : bed bugs. I was dead tired when I went to bed that night, having had travelled all the way from Koh Tao and had gotten an excuse for a sleep in the bus to Bangkok. But as soon as I put out the lights, I started itching. I saw one on the white bed sheet and killed it. Then I remembered that I had seen the hostel staff fumigating my bed earlier in the afternoon. Goddammit! I went down and got myself shifted to another dorm. I also took a hot water bath and washed my clothes in boiling water. I stayed up for a while to see if this one had bugs. It did. I killed two and then tried sleeping with the blanket below me, a technique that had saved me in Baijnath. I woke up the next day with more bites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was ravaged and sleep deprived. I was fixing myself some toasts for breakfast when Poon, the manager of the hostel came up to me and apologised for the bugs. He offered to refund a night&amp;rsquo;s worth but I just asked for a clean bed instead. He told me how he had to close the hostel for a month a while earlier to deal with the bugs. Now they were making a reappearance. It&amp;rsquo;s not exactly the hostel&amp;rsquo;s fault that there are bugs. Bed bugs have nothing to do with cleanliness. They spread by infesting luggage of travellers and hitching a ride to the next destination. I decided to give the place another night before deciding whether to get out or not. I took another scalding hot shower to rid myself of any bugs. But it&amp;rsquo;s never simple once you have been bitten. You feel them even when there is nothing on your skin. It&amp;rsquo;s a horror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7652/27039696884_20a8e22011.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;hostel-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;The otherwise super cool hostel&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;pickle-of-nostalgia&#34;&gt;Pickle of Nostalgia&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had some excellent noodle soup for lunch and then walked around like the day before. My camera&amp;rsquo;s battery died at the first temple but I pushed on. I am not a photographer, so I can always revert to mobile or no photography. I saw the reclining Buddha and a few other temples. Most of the ruins don&amp;rsquo;t have an entrance fee. It is just the more popular ones that charge a small fee. I completed most of the old city on foot today. There was not much left anyway so it was a shorter walk than the day before. On the way back I saw &lt;em&gt;Ganesha&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Saraswati&lt;/em&gt; idols, amongst others, kept under a tree. Hinduism was definitely alive in this city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was walking back to the hostel, I saw something that made me double back. I expressed my desire to taste the edible and the elderly lady who was sitting at the stall offered me a piece. Yes! This was what I had thought it was : &lt;em&gt;ber ka achaar&lt;/em&gt; or wild berry pickle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7502/27072238463_c2fd7c2c4b.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;281&#34; alt=&#34;ber-ka-achaar-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Ber ka Achaar!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to have it as a kid when I went to my grandmother&amp;rsquo;s place in Tatanagar. I bought a small pack from her, must have been 250 grams or so. Then I went to the &lt;strong&gt;Phra Ram Park&lt;/strong&gt; and found a nice spot in front of the lake to sit down and enjoy the packet of pickle. Three school girls sat at a distance, probably bunking school. I ate every piece with relish, recalling random memories of my childhood. I used to sneak into the store room to steal the &lt;em&gt;achaar&lt;/em&gt;. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember who my accomplice used to be? Kunal Bhaiya? Kanika Didi? Why did Ma and Nani stop making these? I think it was too much effort. My mouth was scraped by the seeds and I had a small pile of them in front of me. I sucked the last drop of the sweet and sour syrup from the plastic packet. I laughed when I thought of how Ma was so disapproving of eating so much of this &lt;em&gt;achaar&lt;/em&gt;. Stomach ache; heat; I did not care. I was happy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7693/27072237793_01d35f08f2.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;281&#34; alt=&#34;ber-ka-achaar-3&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;I ate all that!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I resumed walking to the hostel. The girls had been caught by the police officers patrolling the park and been sent away. For some reason it struck me as amusing. I picked up a &amp;ldquo;Lipton Iced Tea&amp;rdquo; from Seven Eleven. I was drinking a &lt;strong&gt;LOT&lt;/strong&gt; of iced tea these days. It helped me keep myself hydrated. I could hear &amp;ldquo;Another One Bites the Dust&amp;rdquo; from outside the hostel. A pleasant change from the blues and jazz. I went inside to see that the hostel dwellers had discovered the vinyl collection. I browsed it to find some really cool albums. There was Dylan, Beatles, Queen, The Who, Clapton and more. I spent the rest of the night playing random albums and reading. I got talking with an English boy who was travelling after graduating from school. His name was Luke (hopefully not Skywalker!), Manchester United was his club and he lived a little south of Manchester. We talked about EPL, the upcoming Euro, his travel plans and mine. He was the most soft spoken English guy I have ever met. I had to strain my ears to listen to what he was saying and many a times I laughed and nodded without a clue as to what he had said!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The common room slowly cleared out and once again I was the last one to leave. A Thai guy started playing random tunes on an electric guitar. His style was nice and dreamy. I listened a while and then went to bed myself. Time to face the horror again. How I wished the bugs gone. This hostel would have been perfect otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;extension&#34;&gt;Extension&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy that I had been bitten just twice in the last night, I decided to extend the stay in this hostel. But part of the reason was that I was lazy to find another place for a couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip #8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If bugged, leave as soon as possible. That&amp;rsquo;s the only way to deal with bed bugs. Check your clothes or heat dry them as soon as you can, take hot water showers yourself and get the hell out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was drinking coffee when a Thai girl started talking to me. This was Bella and we had crossed paths last night when I spooked her out while she was going to her dorm. She was really excited that I was from India and wanted to know more about the country. She worked as a safety engineer near Ayutthaya and was also a tattoo artist. Her energy was contagious. She wanted to travel and was trying to find a reason to do so. She asked everyone their&amp;rsquo;s, hoping to find one that appealed to her. She was surprised to learn that I was married and wanted to know how it worked between me and my wife. Her boyfriend was dominant and possessive and did not like her going out. I guess Thailand was similar to India in this regard. We talked for a bit and she taught me some Thai words. She also told me a place to go eat and I went there with Luke to grab a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That particular place had sold out it&amp;rsquo;s stock though. So we sat at the noodle soup place and had a bowl each of delicious noodle soup. We talked about the English economy and how easy or difficult it was to find a job there. Luke was going to be the fourth generation of his family in the company that he was going to join. I told him about my drifting in the Indian startup scene. He had his apprehensions about this way of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luke and I went exploring the town together later that afternoon. We rented out a couple of bicycles and went towards one of the spots that looked interesting on the map. We cycled through some pretty roads with a lake on one side. Then we got to the first stop, a very European looking memorial of some crocodile slaying and shark fighting king (&lt;strong&gt;Monument of King Naresuan the Great&lt;/strong&gt;). It would be interesting to read his legend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Crocodile slaying King Naresuan the Great&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a stupa (&lt;strong&gt;Wat Phu Khao Thong&lt;/strong&gt;) right next to it and we climbed up it&amp;rsquo;s steep stairs. A light wind was blowing and a mullah was calling out for evening prayers from somewhere close by. Both of these soothed our tired mind and body and we stood on the top level for a few minutes. There was a door open to what seemed like the inner chamber of the stupa and we went inside. I did not even know that stupas had an inner chamber! The inside was a small heavily decorated room with idols and banners. I came out quickly because it was really hot and stuffy inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Inner chamber&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final destination that I had in mind was &lt;strong&gt;Queen Si Suriyothai Memorial&lt;/strong&gt;. The road till was a pretty uncrowded one that was lined with green paddy fields and small rustic huts. The ride in itself was quite enjoyable and the memorial looked exquisite! It was flanked by a lake on one side and a European style boulevard on the other. We had approached the Memorial from the behind, in my usual style, and went around the encircling road. I spotted a dragon lizard (water monitor) and tried to follow it for a better view but the shy creature slid into the lake when I got too near. Luke seemed to be enjoying this little adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Dragon Lizard!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went around to the front of the memorial. A biking gang was clicking selfies and a few more people were celebrating the day out. But there was no foreign tourist there other than the two of us. It seemed extremely weird that people did not make even this small an effort to get to such a gem of a place. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s true what they say about the &amp;ldquo;backpackers&amp;rdquo;. They are all following the same beaten path, one after the other, living in the echo chamber of reviews and travel books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made a small stop at &lt;strong&gt;Wat Lokayasutharam&lt;/strong&gt; to see the reclining Buddha before heading back to the hostel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7344/27372939380_6b4fc60353.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;biking-rec-buddha-3&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Buddha be chill&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat in the common room after taking yet another bath. I read for a while and then bid Luke goodbye before heading out to hunt for food. Luke had his train to Chiang Mai in a bit. I ended up at the riverside market opposite to the museum that I had seen on the first day. The place was really lively at night. There were sea food stalls that I skipped. I ate some pork sausages that were passable and a Roti Mataba at a Muslim stall. It as more or less a Mughlai Parantha. I topped it with some iced tea. All for 90 THB!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7394/27651026305_f181b755bc.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;night-market-6&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Roti Mataba&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the hostel I watched &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3460252/&#34;&gt;The Hateful Eight&lt;/a&gt; with one of the guys from the hostel staff. The volume was a problem for some of the people sitting in the common room and I had to repeat some of the dialogues out of memory. When I hit the bunk, someone in the room, probably the one below me, started snoring really loud. I somehow managed to sleep, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abrupt-ending&#34;&gt;Abrupt Ending&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was not bitten during the night, at least none that I could make out. But I woke up to one of the girls talking on her phone with her parents. They were trying to figure out whether there were bugs in her bed or not. I later saw that her entire leg was covered with bites. Anyway, the three guys in the dorm apart from her (myself included) assured her that there were bugs and she freaked out some more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went out to the balcony and saw that the sun was out. It had been an overcast few days thus far. That was when I suddenly decided to end my stay in Ayutthaya. I unpacked my luggage and inspected it thoroughly. I also went along the seams of the bag. Then I repacked everything and went to take another bath. Once I was done, I checked out and returned the bicycle. I managed to grab a bite at the chicken and rice joint that Bella had suggested the previous day. It was really good! Then I picked up my luggage and got out of the hostel. It had been a weird stay and I can still not make up my mind whether I loved it or dreaded it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/8/7375/27040944333_e18626dc74.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;chicken-rice&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Bella&#39;s recommendation üëç&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could not find a &lt;em&gt;tuk-tuk&lt;/em&gt; so I started walking. After a while, one stopped and picked me up. It already had two women inside. They were French and this was the day that I learnt that Quechua is a French company and not Brazilian as I had previously imagined. One of the girls had been in Thailand for six months now, teaching English in villages along the Myanmar border. The two were travelling eastward. I talked to them till it was time for their train. Mine was in another half hour. I managed to consume another glass of iced tea in that duration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like I have been planning a solo backpacking trip overseas for ages now. I like travelling alone for various reasons. I guess that&amp;rsquo;s just the loner in me wanting some time for himself. I have travelled in India alone to quite a few places which is pretty great in itself. In a country like India, with so diverse a culture and such different landscapes, one can travel the world within the country. But the urge to make an overseas trip was fuelled mostly by a curiosity which came into being at a time I had never been abroad. However, there were many factors to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one, Indians rarely &amp;ldquo;travel&amp;rdquo;. I had never known anyone personally who did. There are vacations with family and friends which last 4-5 days. I once made the ambitious plan of travelling in Eastern Europe for three weeks. If you do manage to overcome the problem with mentality, there are other things that need to be heeded to. There are technicalities involved for an Indian traveller. The visas are a big problem. But I had never reached that stage in my travel plans. I got till dreaming of itineraries and assuming budgets and trying to save up money. A stable job meant that I would only get a certain number of days off when I would. My longest breaks were the ones which I took between jobs. But somehow, something came up every time I was prepared to travel. It could be a friend&amp;rsquo;s bachelor party that sapped me of my leaves and savings. Or it could be a flood in Uttarakhand that urged me to go and help out the best I could. There were the yearly treks that I did. Time and money never seemed to be available in synchronization despite me making efforts for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After years of trying, I finally understood that I was doing it all wrong. I could not make plans and sit around waiting for things to fall in place. I needed to be more proactive than that. There were a lot of odds to fight against but as always, there is always a way out if you &lt;strong&gt;REALLY&lt;/strong&gt; want one. So I quit my job in the August of 2015, travelled India on budget, got married as well (why not?), travelled more within the country, went for a three week backpacking trip in Myanmar with my newly acquired wife, learnt how to swim and then took off for a trip through South East Asia like I had always wanted to. I was dismissive of all deterring arguments. I cared not what was happening to me or around me. This trip was all that mattered right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-to-koh-tao&#34;&gt;Getting to Koh Tao&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was taking a train from Pune to Chennai and flying out from there. AirAisa offers super cheap tickets to Bangkok from Chennai. My eventual destination was to Surat Thani after a brief layover and then to Koh Tao, a small island known as a diving heaven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEA Tip #1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cheapest flights from India to South East Asia are from Chennai. Usually Air Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7192/26931433324_3898d1f636.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;pune-railway-station&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Pune Railway Station&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning there was chaos. Pune station was chaos, as is to be expected from any Indian railway station. People mindlessly crowding the walkway leading to a human traffic jam. I had enough time on my hands though. The train was a special express from Mumbai to Chennai. I was fortunate to even get a ticket when I did. All the other options were full. I mostly stayed put in my upper berth during the entire journey. A &lt;em&gt;Gujju&lt;/em&gt; family sat below and the few other men seemed too preoccupied to talk to. I contended myself with reading my Kindle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting from Chennai Central to the airport is one of the easiest things to do. Walk over to Chennai Park station and buy a ticket for 10 INR to Tirusulam. Get on the train and you are there in half an hour. Easy peasy. I got off at Minambakkam though, one stop before Tirusulam. I remembered using the money exchange there the last time I was taking a flight from Chennai. I walked around but was unable to spot the one that I had used before. I ended up using the one that offered the best rate and got 300 USD for the sake of emergencies. The Myanmar trip had taught me a thing or two about long travels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked to the airport and got the CISF &lt;em&gt;jawan&lt;/em&gt; to let me in. He complained, as usual, about it being too early but he took pity on me when I told him it was too hot to walk around. I settled myself on one of the seats and read the book till it was time to check in. The man at the check-in counter wanted to see a return ticket as well. I asked him why he needed that when I already had a visa. He told me it would be needed at emigration. Bullshit! It was not required at emigration. The emigration officer happily stamped my passport and did not give two cents about what tickets I had. It was the same in Thailand. These idiotic rules are enforced more by the flight companies than the immigration offices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip #6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be prepared to face ridiculous demands from airline counters. They will ask you to produce documents that are not required by the immigration departments. Sadly, there is no easy way around this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My flight to Bangkok was uneventful. I slept some and read some. Then there was the layover in Bangkok for a few hours before I could board the flight to Surat Thani. It was early in the morning when I boarded and an hour later I had landed in Surat Thani. It was raining out here. I had not expected the rains this soon into my trip. I got my luggage and went out to get some USD exchanged and check the ferry options to Koh Tao. I also needed a local SIM. The exchange gave me a decent rate. I got 200 USD worth and then went to inquire at the &lt;strong&gt;Songserm&lt;/strong&gt; counter. The lady told me that the bus was going to leave immediately and I would miss it if I were to waste time buying a SIM. I confirmed whether I would get one in Koh Tao and then bought a &amp;ldquo;joint ticket&amp;rdquo; for 850 THB. She quickly gave me the tickets and stuck a sticker on my shirt. Then I was ushered out to where the bus was standing. I chose a seat and the bus started immediately after. I tried catching up on some sleep but the air-conditioner was relentlessly breathing down my back. It was raining outside. The rains usually bring out the brooder in me. I thought about how what I was doing was so exciting and scary at the same time. I had no idea of what was going to happen in the next few days. It was radically different from how I had lived my life thus far. If my life was a book, I had just bleached all the upcoming chapters and picked up the pen. Of course I was scared. Of course I was excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7448/27506409296_dd647ea8f9.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;surat-thani-rains&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Rains in Surat Thani&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bus took us to Donsak pier where a boat stood waiting. The rain had picked up a little which meant that I was a tad bit wet by the time I got in. The air-conditioner here was uncomfortably cold as well. I tried sleeping through the journey. The boat started it&amp;rsquo;s long trip on choppy waters. Since the boat was a big one, it swayed ever so gently under the assault of such huge waves. I drifted in and out of sleep. The first stop was Koh Samui, the biggest island of this area. Some people got off and some got in. Next was Koh Phangan, the party island famous for it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;full moon parties&lt;/strong&gt;. I had missed that by a few days, though it did not matter. I doubt I would have gone there anyway; I am not much of a party person. A lot of people with big backpacks got in here. I kept to myself and slept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7291/27264252520_6397dfd675.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;koh-tao-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Reaching Koh Tao&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next stop was Koh Tao. The boat almost emptied here. I was part of a long, slow moving queue that took me from the boat to the pier and then to the road outside. It had rained here as well. The sky was still overcast but there was a brief respite from the showers. While others around me were getting taxis, I consulted the map and walked towards my hostel. It turned out to be just a couple of minutes walk from the pier. I walked upstairs to the reception and got myself checked in. A Thai girl showed me to my room. I had been put a 8-bed dorm and all the room was full of girls. It probably sounds exciting in theory but the state of the room was a horror! I had to tiptoe around to get to my bunk. I somehow managed to find a nook for my bag as well. Dao (the hostel staff who showed me my room) told me that she would give me another room the next day. I introduced myself to the girls. They were from England and one of them had been to India recently. That was about the only conversation I had with the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went out looking for a SIM card. Internet is one luxury that I would like to indulge in. Though it is not necessary in Thailand since every single place has WiFi, I like having a constant connection on the move. I walked around the lane near the &lt;strong&gt;Mae Haad&lt;/strong&gt; pier and found a mobile shop. I talked to the guy there and got a tourist SIM for 15 days. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t cheap, 650 THB but it had more than enough data to keep me worry free. The guy at the shop turned out to be one with Nepali roots and was born in Tyaunggyi, Myanmar. I talked a bit to him about Myanmar and India and he showed off his skills with Hindi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked on towards &lt;strong&gt;Sairee Beach&lt;/strong&gt;. There are a lot of taxis that can take you there but I prefer walking. Apart from the obvious health benefits, you get the flexibility of choosing which way to turn, stopping when you find something interesting and you see and absorb more than what you would in a taxi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip #7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walk as much as you can. It is healthy, saves you money and lets you absorb things that you would otherwise miss!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a downside to walking though - you are not weatherproof. It was raining intermittently but the rains were light enough to let me walk on. There were diving schools all around. At Mae Haad, on the road to Sairee, at Sairee. It was too overwhelming to think of going some of them and talk around. How do I even choose which ones to talk to? So I left the activity for the following day and ate a Pad Thai from a street side stall. Sairee beach wasn&amp;rsquo;t much in itself, specially since it was raining. But there were a lot of pubs all over the place. The place must really come alive at night!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked back as the showers picked up a little in intensity. I changed into a dry set at the hostel. The girls were getting ready to go out for the evening. I went to the common room and sat down for a couple of beers and my laptop. People tend to leave me alone since I always have my nose in my laptop, kindle or the phone (in that order). Usually I prefer it and so it was today. I was tired and sleep deprived. I had a couple of &lt;em&gt;Changs&lt;/em&gt; and went to bed. I was woken up by some commotion in the middle of the night, around 2 AM, when the girls returned. It took them forever to settle down but once they did, I drifted back to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;doubts&#34;&gt;Doubts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next day I went to one of the schools that I had researched online. Almost every school has a good rating on the forums so that was not much help. I chose one that sounded nice - &lt;em&gt;Pura Vida&lt;/em&gt; (a Costa Rican term which roughly means pure life). I walked into their shop and was greeted with a &amp;ldquo;Hola!&amp;rdquo;. I did not know there was a thing as Spanish school. Pura Vida was one, Simple Life another. There were German and French schools as well! That probably explained so many schools. Anyway, I talked to the girl at the front desk. They could instruct in English and the rates were pretty good because of an ongoing discount. Then I talked about the problem that had been troubling me the most. I was not very comfortable in open waters. Would that be a problem? She asked one of the instructors and he told me that I needed to swim for around 10 minutes in open waters. That was actually one of the first tests in the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had never swam for 10 continuous minutes. This piece of information troubled me further. I told them that I would come back later after having an answer to whether I could swim that long. I walked back to the hostel with a heavy feeling in my chest. There was just one reason why I was there in Koh Tao. I had put up with all the bullshit of visas and return tickets to go to Thailand for just one reason. I wanted to do my &lt;strong&gt;Open Waters&lt;/strong&gt; diving certification. Now it seemed like the a far fetched dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time I reached the hostel, I had a vague plan. Dao asked me if I wanted to change rooms and I nodded eagerly. She moved me to another dorm which was slightly less messy, despite not having as many girls. I concluded that making a mess was a gender independent and age specific characteristic. Two young boys in this dorm were responsible for all the bags and clothes strewn around. I picked up my stuff and headed out. &lt;strong&gt;Ao Leuk&lt;/strong&gt; is considered one of the better places for snorkelling on the island and that was where I was headed. The walk to Ao Leuk was quite beautiful. The road inclined and declined through the interior of the island. There was greenery all around and the island was maintained in a really clean state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7347/26931342184_c827fb1eae.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ao-leuk-walk-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Beautiful Island roads&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A woman demanded 100 THB as entrance charge for Ao Leuk. Apparently it is private beach. I came to know later that this was a very recent development. The bay was quite beautiful but the tide was low and the water somewhat shallow. It was not very crowded and I found a spot for myself. I rented out a snorkel and a mask from one of places on the small beach and went into the water. I snorkelled for a bit but there was nothing to see in the middle. Plus the overcast sky and low tide rendered the visibility low. I came back to leave the snorkel on the beach and went back to the water. Time to answer the big question. I went in till I was neck deep in the water and kicked myself away. I checked my watch every couple of minutes as I kicked to stay afloat. Sea water is definitely easier to float in and I managed more than 10 minutes! So the diving plan was definitely on! I swam back to the shore a happier man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7049/26932299583_ac7648a956.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ao-leuk-4&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Ao Leuk&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the rest of the day lounging on the beach. I wanted to get my 100 baht worth! I read a bit and slept a bit. I went to snorkel again and went into deeper waters this time. There was more marine life near the rocks and some beautiful fishes. Despite the recent success with floating, I still panic in deep waters. My snorkel got flooded once the way it had done in Boracay. I freaked out initially as I had done in Philippines but then when I realised that there was no one around to help me, I tried working things out. I was unable to spit out the snorkel and removing the mast was not an option since my hands were occupied with keeping me afloat. I slowly drank the water that was there in the tube and voila! The snorkel was clear again; I could breathe again! It is wonderful how much a calm mind can accomplish. After that I tried some new skills with the snorkel before heading out of water. I also tested my new camera&amp;rsquo;s water resistance. The afternoon at Ao Leuk had left me with a sense of accomplishment and my confidence in myself had gone up a notch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Testing the camera&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to head back to the hostel as the sun was going down. I roamed around for a bit with a bottle of Chang and a pack of sweet banana chips. Koh Tao is rather expensive but I guess half of the reason is because it&amp;rsquo;s an island far from the mainland, the other half being the touristic nature of South Thailand. I walked around till the sun set and returned to the hostel after dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEA Tip #2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything is somewhat expensive in Koh Tao; lodging, food, even water. In fact, southern Thailand is more expensive because of it&amp;rsquo;s touristic nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guys in my dorm were going for a pub crawl. I considered but then passed. I sat in the common room with a beer. A few Thai men came in and started playing music. Guitar, bass and saxophone. There was barely a crowd and the band wasn&amp;rsquo;t really tight. But it was fun nevertheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7505/26932276583_cb7f85a1b2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;common-room-jam&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Common Room Jam&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got talking to the bartender who turned out to be the manager at MOOV. Her name was Koko. She was Polish and had been in Koh Tao for 10 months now. I drank a couple of beers and then was considering retiring when the jamming ended. Dao called me to the table where the Thais had gathered with an Englishman, Johnny, and a Seattle guy, Jake. Koko joined us for a bit. It was a merry party that proceeded as randomly as it&amp;rsquo;s members. One of the Thai girls told me I would end up getting drunk on the Thai whiskey. The Seattle guy asked me four times where I was from and told me at length how he liked Bollywood and T-20. I did not tell him I did not care about either of those. The Englishman was trying to woo a drunk Thai girl. The party disbanded slowly, one member at a time, till I was the only one left. I cleaned up a bit and left for the room. My watch said 3 AM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;walking-around-koh-tao&#34;&gt;Walking around Koh Tao&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up the next day and went to talk to some of the dive schools that Koko had suggested the night before. I walked all the way up to Sairee and back. I talked to Crystal, Mojo and Golden. The prices were similar, though not same. I was slightly in favour of Mojo but had not decided yet. I returned to the common room and sat looking at a book of Koh Tao for ideas of how to spend the day. Koko was around and she suggested that I go to &lt;strong&gt;Chalok&lt;/strong&gt;. I took her up on that one. She also suggested a good place for Thai food which was on the way to Chalok. The food at &lt;strong&gt;Tukta&lt;/strong&gt; was probably the best I have had in Koh Tao (maybe even Thailand). I ate some red curry with rice and then continued my walk to Chalok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7559/27506317176_2ab3f57fab.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tukta-red-curry&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Kevin loves Tukta!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chalok was nice and uncrowded, quite opposite to what Sairee was. I walked along the beach towards the north and came across the concrete pathway that Koko had told me about. However, this looked like private property to me and I wondered if I should turn back. Had it not been for a fuzzy black dog that had decided to guide me, I would have done so. This dog nonchalantly jumped on the bridge and looked at me in expectation. I gulped down my apprehensions of trespassing and jumped from boulder to boulder onto the pathway. Then the dog led me forward to the next part of the beach which had even fewer people and a calmer bay. The dog dug himself a spot in the sand in the shade of a rock and lay down. I continued on the concrete path. It led me to another beach with even fewer people and small trees with hammocks on them. This was &lt;strong&gt;Freedom Beach&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7040/26932272623_b0bfa31f0c.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;chalok-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Chalok Bay&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Pretty concrete pathways around Chalok&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spread out my towel under a tree and lay down. I went to the water for a bit but the sea floor had a lot of corals. I ended up relaxing on the beach, reading and swinging on a hammock. I took a nap as well and watched people chill out in the water and out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7783/26931290254_ac64bb2a82.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;freedom-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Freedom Beach&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left around 4 in the evening and went up another way. There was a viewpoint that I decided to skip because of the 50 baht entry. Paying for &amp;ldquo;viewpoints&amp;rdquo; seems plain stupid to me. I walked back to Chalok and tried finding a way to Mae Haad along the beach rather than taking the direct road back. I hit a dead end at a resort and went back. I did a tiring climb up a hilly road to bypass the resorts and found a really good viewpoint of my own which I did not have to pay for. I could see the entire Chalok Bay and the Freedom beach from here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7122/27468424731_f3e5d771a3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;chalok-viewpoint-3&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;View of the entire Chalok Bay&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The road went down to the sea side again and I came across a very quiet and uncrowded beach - &lt;strong&gt;Sai Nuan&lt;/strong&gt;. Here I walked through a pretty path that led through the resorts. I no longer cared about trespassing. There were huts built on the rocks right at the edge of the sea. I saw some really picturesque views and sat to enjoy the setting sun from a random rock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7389/27264083950_0e2b8e9cc8.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;walkway-3&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Pretty resorts along the sea&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kept walking through the pretty path that went through more resorts and a private beach. No one questioned me and I happily ambled on. Right before I was about to hit the town, I saw a group of Thai men playing &lt;em&gt;chinlone&lt;/em&gt;. I stood watching them play and considered joining them. They gladly accommodated me and I did not suck as bad as I thought I would! I was happy and content after twenty minutes of playing with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to dinner with one of the guys in my dorm room. His name was Thimo and he was Swizz. He was taking a break after the military service before he would go back to join school. He was doing his Open Waters course at Golden and was full of praises for them. That settled the question of a school. I was going to sign up at Golden the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;learning-to-dive&#34;&gt;Learning to dive&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got up to a sunny day and walked to the Golden Divers&amp;rsquo; shop. I signed up for the course and paid an advance. The guy who signed me up was a dive master and told me that the instructors were out for the day. He asked me whether I wanted to start immediately or later in the day. I chose to start later because that would give me the chance to meet my instructor as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a few restless hours till 4 PM and then left for the dive school again. I withdrew some money for paying the remaining amount and, to my surprise, my account was debited in INR. There was no silly post conversion rate and service charge like there had been with the Myanmar withdrawals. I even got a decent conversion rate. The instructors had not returned from their dives and after waiting for a bit, the dive master set me up for the first lesson. There was video, some reading and an exercise sheet at the end of each lesson. The videos had interesting content but were painfully slow. While I was doing my first exercise, my instructor came in and introduced himself. Emile was going to instruct me and he was the one that Thimo had had as well and had assured me was a really cool guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished two sections before leaving for the day. Thimo and I went to get some delicious noodle soup before sitting in the common room. I got talking to two of the others who were sitting there. There was Lucian, a Romanian guy and Katie, a Canadian girl of Greek origin. Katie told me some really great things about Cambodia that I am looking forward to. Lucian had been travelling for seven months in Asia now and was at the end of his journey. The talk drifted to Europe, then to politics, to USA and Canada, India and the Koreas. Katie had been teaching English in South Korea for the past year. There were things that I got to know that I would have never known otherwise. I unwillingly put the interesting conversation to an end because I had to get up early the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to Golden by 9 AM the next morning. It took a glass of cold Thai coffee to bring me out of sleep. I did another section of theory and then Emile went over the first two sections in more detail, stressing on the more important points. Then he showed me the equipments and explained them to me. We packed up a bag for my gear and left for the boat at 11. There were two more Germans doing their final day of Open Waters and another guy, Ippo, who was training to be a master diver. There was a group of Thai men, apparently firefighters from Bangkok who were doing their advanced course. This motley crowd made the boat&amp;rsquo;s customers as we headed out into the sea. The water was rough and it tossed the boat around like a little toy. Ippo, Emile and the Thai guys went down to the first site, which was the shipwreck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul, the other instructor, showed me how to set up and dismantle the entire gear. Then we went up to the deck and lay down to ease the seasickness. We resumed once the others had returned. I was so sick that I was in half a mind to call the entire thing off. But once we got to the sheltered side of &lt;strong&gt;Nang Yuan&lt;/strong&gt;, the water became much calmer and I immediately felt better. I was ready when Emile called me down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up was the swimming test. Last evening I had told Emile about my lack of confidence in open waters so he got down into the waters with me today, telling me how to position myself in the water. There was a slight current on one side which made swimming a little difficult but I was anyway not swimming with my head under water. The water splashed against my face and I freaked out a bit but the imminent presence of Emile helped me get through the test. I completed the two rounds of the boat and went up. I realised how difficult it was to drown in sea water. I had been stiff with fear throughout but had still made it somehow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we put on the scuba equipment and went to the shallower waters near the beach to do some exercises. I managed to do all the exercises without a problem and consequently we returned to the boat before the other had finished their dives. Once they were back, we went to another dive site for the advanced divers, White Rock. The sea was still rough but I did not feel as sick as I had felt the first time. There were dark clouds coming in from the western sky. The winds had picked up speed and a few rain drops fell with intensity. The sea is so different from a mountain. You can see the awe of a mountain whereas the sea shows you only a smooth surface. It&amp;rsquo;s might is deceptively soothing.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Roughing it out&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We returned to the pier after the divers returned. There was a brief rain as we unloaded but the clouds passed the island by. The German couple showed me how to clean the equipment back at the shop. Then I sat for some more theory. There were some charts and basic maths that was fun to do so I ended up doing the entire theory including the quizzes and the final exam! I just got one question wrong in the entire set and Emile was more heartbroken by that than I was. The guys congratulated me and I headed back to the hostel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thimo was leaving by the night ferry to Koh Phi Phi. I sat with him for a beer and then had some dinner after he left. There was no crowd in the hostel tonight. The &amp;ldquo;Full Moon Wave&amp;rdquo;, as they call it, had died and the next bout of tourists would arrive a few days before the next Full Moon party at Koh Phangan. I worked a bit and then hit the sack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;diving-days&#34;&gt;Diving days&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up a little late the next day since I had finished all the theory. All that was left was diving! I reached the shop around 10:30 and Emile was waiting with my bag ready. We left for the boat at 11; there were just the three of us today - Ippo, Emile and I. The sea was much calmer than yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first dive site was Junkyard, straight off Sairee Beach. Emile told us that it was called so because of the junk that was dumped there. He told us about a lot of cool things like gym machines and cages that we would see underwater, none of which we saw because the boat had probably tagged to the wrong buoy line. However, the main motive of diving here was so that I could get better at my buoyancy control. The site had plain sandy floor which was ideal for practicing. I floundered at first and then got better. We did some exercises underwater as well and saw some cool fishes. One was a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Scrawled_filefish_(_Aluterus_scriptus_).jpg&#34;&gt;Filefish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that was suspended vertically inside a metal mesh. And we also saw a family of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Clown_fish_in_the_Andaman_Coral_Reef.jpg&#34;&gt;Clownfish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that were extremely cute. The parents rushed out on our approach so as to shield their kids. The little ones hung around in the back looking on with, what I assumed was, curiosity. We also saw some small fishes using beer bottles as their homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next dive site was Three Rocks. This one was off Jansom Bay, the private beach that I had trespassed a couple of days ago. We went in and I sunk faster than I should have. I hit the bottom of beautiful corals and tried making myself buoyant. This site was much shallower and the sunny day meant excellent visibility. It was like walking through a beautiful garden of corals and colourful fishes. It was a visual treat! There were some really cool fishes as well : a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/61/Blue_spotted_stingray_NTB.jpg&#34;&gt;blue spotted stingray&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Barracuda_laban.jpg/640px-Barracuda_laban.jpg&#34;&gt;barracuda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Tylosurus_crocodilus_crocodilus_R%C3%A9union.jpg&#34;&gt;crocodile needlefish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and many more that I could not identify. It is also possible to spot the island&amp;rsquo;s turtle here. It is a big &lt;strong&gt;Hawksbill Turtle&lt;/strong&gt; but unfortunately we did not see it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, I don&amp;rsquo;t have underwater shots because I was learning to dive. That took all my concentration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reached back by two in the afternoon. I cleaned all the equipment and went back to the hostel. I did some laundry and since it was too hot to sit in the common room, decided to go find a cafe to work in. I ended up walking mindlessly like I always do and did another tiring climb to reach the top of &lt;strong&gt;Sai Daeng&lt;/strong&gt; beach. There was an excellent view of the beach and &lt;strong&gt;Shark Island&lt;/strong&gt; up ahead but I did not go down since my tired mind could not digest the idea of climbing up again. I went back down the way I had come and sat in a small cafe to rest my tired legs. Walking after diving is not really the brightest of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;View of Sai Daeng and Shark Island&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back to the hostel in the evening. There was no one else around so I sat at the bar talking to Koko. She showed me her home in Poland and I showed her some pictures of India. She also heaped up more praises for Cambodia on top of what Katie had already left me with. Koko used to be a professional photographer and some of her work was simply breathtaking. We talked till midnight and left for our rooms when her shift got over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a few more divers the next day. There was a couple doing Discover Scuba and another girl who was starting her Open Waters. We headed out towards Nang Yuan again. The water had seemed clearer at the pier but it was actually a bit rougher than the last day. The first site was Red Rock. The visibility was not great and almost immediately after entering the water, I had trouble in my left ear. I think there was an air pocket stuck inside and it pained terribly and took really long to equalize. I had no visual reference except Emile and while I was thinking that I am making a fool of myself at 5-6 meters, Emile managed to slowly get me down to the floor. It was more than 17 meters but I was not completely at ease. We swam around and my buoyancy was better than the last day. However, I screwed up with the exercise. The unease in the ear and the bad visibility robbed this dive of any fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cleared my ear while we waited for the others to come back. I lied down on my side and eventually something popped and I felt slightly better. The next dive site was on the other side of Nang Yuan. This one was called The Twins. It went much better here; my ears were equalizing properly and my buoyancy worked better. We saw a BIG &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Arothron_meleagris_by_NPS_1.jpg&#34;&gt;puffer fish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, two &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Picasso.triggerfish.arp.jpg&#34;&gt;trigger fishes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; at uncomfortably close quarters, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/White_eyed_moray_eel.jpg&#34;&gt;white eyed moray eel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and many more colourful fishes. This was the dive which I probably enjoyed the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back on the boat, Emile congratulated me on completing the course successfully and we went back to the shop to do the certification. I was now an Open Water diver. Hurrah!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;With Emile&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to Sairee that night in search of some good seafood. There were pubs promoting themselves by handing out flyers that could be exchanged for free shots. I had enough to get me decently drunk but I was not in a mood to party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Nightclubs at Sairee&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was happily tired and feeling accomplished. I ate some roast duck and rice at the far end of Sairee Beach, walked back to the hostel, and watched a movie before falling asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Treating myself to rice with roast duck&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;moving-on&#34;&gt;Moving on&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was planning to leave by the night boat to Bangkok today. I had decided on &lt;strong&gt;Ayutthaya&lt;/strong&gt; as my next destination. Apparently Golden has the best rates for boats as well. It sells Songserm tickets at a rate lower than what Songserm sells it at its own office! I checked out the timings of the boats and found out that the afternoon boat would make more sense for me. I would reach Bangkok early next morning and could then proceed to Ayutthaya. However, the tickets for that day were sold out. Wonderful! There were no people on the island but the boat was full. I booked a ticket for the next day and came back to the hostel to extend my stay by a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEA Tip #3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The joint tickets sold by the boat companies in Thailand are good value for money. But do ask around for the best price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I played Jenga with Koko for a bit and then we headed out to get some food from Tukta. Koko had spray painted her bike with matte black that morning and it had come out really cool. Kevin and Koko made friends while we were waiting for the food at Tutka. Then we got some fresh juice and headed back to the hostel to eat the food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Kevin is a lucky bastard&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day had been sunny thus far and I was considering going snorkelling somewhere but all of a sudden the sky darkened and strong winds and rains ensued. The common area got drenched and everyone started drying it up and mopping the excess water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rain slowed down and eventually stopped but the sky remained overcast and the temperature had cooled down. Koko ran about like a maniac all day. Her boyfriend had landed in Bangkok and would reach Koh Tao the next day. She was overflowing with happiness. I was tired of sitting in the hostel all day so I went to find the &lt;em&gt;chinlone&lt;/em&gt; gang towards the evening. They were where I had found them last and I joined them for half an hour of play. They bid me a &amp;ldquo;see you tomorrow&amp;rdquo; when I left but sadly I had tickets out for the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a bath in the hostel and then headed out for another pointless walk. For the sake of exercise if nothing else. Back in the hostel, the Thais were enjoying a barbecue. I joined them and invited the new girl in my dorm to join in as well. We sat there tasting the food and talking. She was Alina from Switzerland. She used to be a photographer but was not getting into the tourism industry. I realised that there had been a Swizz in that dorm room continuously. There was a Swizz girl first, then Thimo and now Alina. That also said something about how long I had stayed in the same place without moving around. Koko showed us her bungalow which she had prepared herself with the help of a few friends. It was really impressive how she had put everything together. I talked to the girls for a bit and then we split. Alina went back to the room, Koko wandered off and I sat with the Thais in the common room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dao showed me some pictures of Ayutthaya when I told her I was going there next. It looked like a really nice place and the Thais were really excited about me going there. We talked a bit and then I left for the room. I had a disturbed sleep because of the constant movement of the person in the bunk below me. He also got up early and that made sleeping late difficult. Anyhow, I packed up and checked out of the room. Then I sat in the common room and dozed off in front of the fan. I woke with a sudden start and checked my watch. It was still 13:20. Phew! I had not missed my boat. The sun was shining relentlessly outside. I was just about to get up and leave when Koko came around. She was on a leave for a couple of days so I was not expecting to see her. We chatted for a few minutes and then I went to pick my bags and she left to wake up her jet-lagged boyfriend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boat came around 14:40 and everyone got in. There was a lot of empty seats. Maybe the buses were full yesterday instead of the boat. An American girl was travelling with a big suitcase. It seemed silly to me that someone would bring a suitcase but she was a young one. At least she was travelling, which is more than I can say about me at her age. And then there are always guys who would love to help a damsel in distress. She found one to help her with getting the suitcase on the boat.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Leaving Koh Tao&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I slept in the boat till a bug bit me awake. I went out to the deck to get away from the bug and the irking cold air-con. There was land up ahead. The Chumphon archipelago slowly got closer and we were docked at the pier within the next hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Approaching Chumphon&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bus took the travellers who had booked the train. The ones who had to take a bus had a few hours of waiting to do. I picked up my bags and started wandering as usual. I ended up in a lively market by the Chumphon seaside. There was a lot of food and drinks going around. The people of Chumphon were celebrating their evening. I ate some fish and chicken for a small fraction of what I had been paying in Koh Tao.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Kevin is spoilt for choice!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked around and realised that I was the only tourist there. I wondered why people travelled without feeling the urge to explore. Maybe they had enough money to get whatever they wanted wherever they found themselves. Anyway, I saw some impressive sand art and ate some delicious food before getting a lemon slushy and watching Thai kids play basketball and badminton.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Impressive sand art near Chumphon pier&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 21:30, the staff ushered us into the bus and we drove out to the main highway where another bus was waiting for us. The American girl with the suitcase had a new suitor now, a French guy, whom she was telling about her spring breaks. The new bus was coming from further south and was already more or less full. I was the last one to board the bus so the seats were limited in choice. I got one that did not recline but then the seat next to mine was empty so I spread out horizontally. The bus made a small stop for dinner and then went on to Bangkok. The roads were smooth and well made and the bus was comfortable. I slept a good sleep despite the weird angle that my neck was dangling in.&lt;/p&gt;
