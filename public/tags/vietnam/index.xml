          <description>

&lt;p&gt;I was travelling in Vietnam recently and towards the end of the third week in the country, reached the amazing city of &lt;a href=&#34;http://grasskode.xyz/post/travel/sea-vietnam-dalat/&#34;&gt;Da Lat&lt;/a&gt;. It was here that I met Mandy and she told me the English tuition center that she worked for was looking for foreign teachers. I knew about such jobs but I also knew that they usually required a certification in TEFL (or TESOL) or for a nativity of the language. I had neither but I asked her anyway, would I be eligible for the job? She was familiar enough with my grasp on English since we had been speaking for the last three days and she said it could be possible for me. This was something so unexpected that I needed time to decide whether I would take her up on the offer. The minimum time of commitment was a month and I had plans to travel further to Cambodia and Laos. If I did take up the teaching job then it would mean having to alter my travel plans considerably. But the longer I thought about it, the more I was convinced that I should do it. I had always been interested in teaching, having done it amateurishly since I was a young boy helping out in Papa&amp;rsquo;s tuition classes or teaching a few kids to earn some pocket money in college. And since I started considering travelling seriously, I had looked up the websites for TEFL certification many times, always thinking that I could use this as a means to earn and stay on the road longer. And here I was, without a certification and a non-native English speaker with the chance to find out what that experience would be like. I was definitely not going to pass on it just because of some silly travel plans that I had made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My visa was about to expire and I felt somewhat stupid at not having taken the 3 month visa to begin with. It was not costing me extra but I had reasoned that I was not really going to use it, so why take it? Now I know better than being so meticulous in my planning but the expiring visa meant that I needed to exit the country and return with another visa before I could start teaching. I had a Cambodian visa ready and the country was the closest exit. So I shelved my further travel plans in Vietnam and went to Cambodia. I had some trouble getting another Vietnamese visa (3 month long this time) in Phnom Penh and then spent a couple of weeks travelling in south Cambodia before heading back to Vietnam. I got in touch with Mandy once I was back in Saigon and she helped me with the details to get to her center. It was in a small highway town not very far from HCMC. I reached on a Monday and Mandy told me I needed to give a demo class before the job would be confirmed. I did it that very evening and since everything went well, I stayed on to teach for the one month that I had committed to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8610/28916188750_f5cbeb5839.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;field-trip-kids-with-camera-9&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;This one&#39;s for the kids!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-reasons&#34;&gt;The Reasons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am honestly at a loss as to where I should begin talking about all I have experienced in the last month. There were the kids, the staff at the centers and the various Vietnamese people I met during the time I taught. I had a few reasons for doing this stint. The first, as I have already mentioned, was that I was always interested in teaching English as a travel job. I saw it as a means to do extensive travelling. I have been exploring options for nomadic lifestyle and have been making some rude discoveries into the nature of digital nomadism, as they call it. But language teaching is a profession that has successfully been around for a long time and would continue to stay around for some time to come. I had always thought that with my love for the language and penchant for teaching, I might somehow fit into the job. But I had no reason to believe that would necessarily be the case. This was the perfect opportunity to find out whether it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another compelling reason to take up such a work was the interaction with Vietnamese people. As a tourist or traveller, even if you put in a lot of effort into it, you barely manage to soak and understand the culture of a country that you are visiting. And it is even more difficult when you do not speak the local language. There had been so many times when I met some people who I thought might be interesting to explore but I could never manage to understand them because we did not speak a common tongue. There are platforms like Couchsurfing which, if done right, give a better exposure to the culture but your experience still remains limited to the point of view of people associated with the travel community in the country. Teaching students who came from all strides of life and all age groups was definitely a big improvement in terms of the kinds of experiences I would have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, and a rather silly, reason was that I wanted to do it as a personal accomplishment. When I had quit my job last year, I had done so with the idea that I needed to understand what else I could do other than make softwares. That was all I had trained for professionally and the only trade I knew. It paid well and I had no complains as such but there was a sense of handicap that I felt whenever I contemplated long enough. I wanted to know if I was even capable of doing something else. The entire travels had been about proving it to myself that I was more as a person than just a software developer. So this opportunity would alleviate a self doubt that had been plaguing me for a while. You never know whether you can till you actually do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;not-all-fun-and-games&#34;&gt;Not All Fun and Games&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you how my first (demo) class went. I was standing in front of a class full of twenty odd kids ranging from the ages of ten to fifteen. They were not very good at English, something that I had somehow now really comprehended by the time I first started speaking to the class. Even I could not understand them completely because they had just begun learning English and I for sure could not understand Vietnamese. Sure there was a Vietnamese teacher to assist me but the entire route suddenly feels so much more cumbersome and you simply become and extraneous part of the equation. There was confusion and chaos all around me. The kids were doing what they do best - being kids. They were talking incessantly with each other and I did not get a single word of it. They were shouting and playing, fighting with each other and giggling at some joke or the other. And somewhere in the midst of it all I stood helplessly trying to draw their attention at something I wanted to tell or ask them! It was confusing, frustrating and at times I felt helpless. I had expected something different; a class full of students who eagerly wanted to learn and would listen to me with all concentration. That was the setup that I had always had the few times I taught in India. But that was a far cry from what I got out here. Suddenly I was wondering how my mother dealt with so many first graders on a daily basis! Suddenly I realised that it was not all fun and games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learnt the tricks of the trade slowly and the experience only got better from there on. I was helped out by the staff or teachers when the classes were very new to English, other times I managed by myself somehow. At first I thought that maybe I was too lax with the classes; that maybe I needed to be stricter with them and keep all the chaos under check. Thankfully, the language barrier made it an impossibility. They would simply not understand what I was ranting about and the problem would only worsen with the confusion. So I learnt ways to work around it. As they say, you learn more when you teach. And I learnt some amazing things. I learnt to be one with the chaos around me and enjoy all the confusion. I used to laugh with the kids without understanding their jokes. I used to help them phrase sentences when they had the inclination to talk to me. I learnt how to grab their attention rather than forcing them to be attentive. The students ran the show in the classes and I just facilitated them with whatever they wanted to do. We played games if they wanted to play. We studied when they felt like doing something from the book. We listened to songs or watched cartoons at times. Somewhere in the middle of all this I was teaching them a few things; adding a few new words to their vocabulary or correcting pronunciations. I learnt how to teach. I learnt how to be less uptight as a person. I learnt how it can be fun even when you are not in control of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Playing tag on a field trip with the kids&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;centers-classes&#34;&gt;Centers &amp;amp; Classes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I taught at 4 of the 5 centers that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/AnhNguQuocTeThaiBinhDuong/&#34;&gt;TBD&lt;/a&gt; has. I used to stay in the center to keep things simple. It was not too big of a hassle and it was much more convenient since I was shifting on a weekly basis anyway. I took two 1.5 hour classes every evening from Monday to Saturday and additional morning classes of similar length on Saturday and Sunday. The batches were divided by age groups and the level of expertise in English. Every age group category that I describe below had various levels, ranging from 1 (starters) to 4 (experts).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The youngest batches that I interacted with were the &lt;strong&gt;Bees&lt;/strong&gt;. Some teachers that I met did not like these batches because its children of age groups 3-5 jumping around and creating a ruckus. I used to love them. We did nursery rhymes and I played with them; picked them up and swung them around. There were some who curiously touched my beard or pulled on my hair. Others hi-fived me with a big smile on their face. The first time I had to take the Bees class I was rather unsure. I did not know what I was supposed to do and mornings are not the best time for me. But over the month I came to look forward to seeing all those children running about. There was one little girl in one of the centers who used to come hug me while I was waiting for the classes to begin. It was a lovely experience; truly lovely. It became a weekend ritual for me and I would end up humming random rhymes for the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg vertimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8149/29170108936_6957554766.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ho-nai-nemo&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;The brilliant Bee&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next batch, age wise was that of &lt;strong&gt;Kids&lt;/strong&gt;. These were slightly older than the Bees and ranged from 7-10 year olds usually. I was not restricted to nursery rhymes though these guys loved it as well. We sang rhymes and danced some &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xmV5uHWNag&#34;&gt;funny dances&lt;/a&gt;. At times I would let them run about the class or draw on the board, trying to make a game out of anything that they felt like doing. Sometimes we watched Charlie Chaplin movies or Doraemon as well; or I introduced them to animals from around the world and showed then videos of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCcLMNcWZOc&#34;&gt;kangaroos boxing&lt;/a&gt;. Once again, the ones who liked me would feel little inhibition in clinging to me and expressing themselves. I loved how they cheered up and shouted a loud &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; whenever I came into the class or started waving when they saw me outside. They were curious about me and asked me for my age and country through their Vietnamese teachers. The resident teachers were always a big help with the Kids and I used to enjoy my classes more when they were around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8177/28916236180_d285d7b534.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;gia-kiem-classes-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Kids love Doraemon!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next two were the &lt;strong&gt;Teens&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Leaders&lt;/strong&gt;. Teens had age groups 10-15 and Leaders were anyone above that age group. At times the Leaders had men and women in their 30&amp;rsquo;s or 40&amp;rsquo;s who were learning English with an enviable enthusiasm. These were the batches where students were more receptive to being taught English rather than just interacting and running about. The younger ones still liked to create a ruckus though while the older batches were comparatively quieter. I used to play word games with them or talk to them if they were the advanced batches. Sometimes we picked up some random topic like adventure sports, or something from my travels, or maybe different cultures and then talked about it for a while. I got to learn so many things from these students - trending songs in K-Pop, comic books, movies, places they want to travel to, the Vietnamese culture and what not. The beginner batches were more about playing games and having fun with whatever little understanding we could get to. The advanced batches were fun because the interaction was more of a dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8776/28583911463_e09f342bd3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;trang-bom-class-3&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Teens and Leaders&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;adaptations&#34;&gt;Adaptations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had an amazing month that words will fall short to describe. It was an emotional roller coaster and something that has given me memories to cherish. In the beginning, nothing came to me naturally though. It was my first time teaching with a big language barrier and there were so many things that I had to do that were outside my comfort zone. These are the things that have made the most lasting impact on me. I can see a clear change in myself from what I was before the month to what I am now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My classes were never fixed. I used to teach new batches every time. Since I was also shifting from one center to another, opting to go wherever they needed me, I barely repeated batches. I repeated one of the Kids batches thrice and that was the maximum frequency I had gotten with any group of students. I usually met them just once or twice. This was barely enough time to either get to know them or build a rapport with them. In the 1.5 hour class I had to break ice with everyone and do the job that I was there for. This was quite a huge task for me since I am not a social person to begin with and my interpersonal skills, to put it mildly, suck. But this was something that I had to learn quickly in order to do any kind of justice to my work. I could not afford to stand quietly in a corner and smile like I usually do when I am in a room full of people. I had to learn how to be forward and draw out students into conversations. I learnt how to make a fool of myself in order to makes the students more comfortable. I learnt how to talk at length about personal experiences when that was what they wanted me to do. I learnt how to be more than what I had ever felt the need to be in 29 years of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Way out of my comfort zone&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the end of session when I joined and busier than usual time. In the 5 weeks that I taught here, I got just two Mondays off. Of course I could have asked for more but I wanted to help them out and I was somewhat enjoying myself with the students. This too took a little adjustment for me. From the 2 day weekend person that I had been while working in India I had just recently adapted to the no weekday or weekend concept of life on the road. Now I had just crashed to the other extreme of working throughout the week. My time off was hours instead of days. I got ample time everyday to pursue other interests like reading, writing and sketching. But the hours were not ample enough to head out to a city or beach nearby to enjoy a short weekend travelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;instagram-media&#34; data-instgrm-version=&#34;7&#34; style=&#34; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;padding:8px;&#34;&gt; &lt;div style=&#34; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&#34;&gt; &lt;div style=&#34; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&#34; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/p/BI0OKAoBZ0H/&#34; style=&#34; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;A photo posted by Karan (@grasskode)&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;time style=&#34; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&#34; datetime=&#34;2016-08-07T17:31:36+00:00&#34;&gt;Aug 7, 2016 at 10:31am PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there was constant need for energy and enthusiasm. I could not afford to go into a class without energy and be boring. The shortness of my interaction with the students meant that I had no opportunities to screw up the little time we had together. My morning grumpy self had to wait till the month ended. The younger the kids were, the more energy and enthusiasm I needed because in the lack of a common language, that was what they picked up on. But the kids helped me out themselves most of the time. They were always full of energy and all I needed to do was put in enough to get through the first five minutes. Then they took care of it themselves. Enthusiasm is, fortunately, infectious. One will find it extremely difficult to stay unaffected when surrounded by so much overflowing energy. I learnt how to keep my enthusiasm about me and it is amazing how everything became so much more beautiful and enjoyable when I joined the kids in their madness. Something as silly as singing rhymes or dancing about doing funny steps did not feel as silly as I had thought it would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;outside-the-classrooms&#34;&gt;Outside the Classrooms&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My need for cultural exchange was satisfied outside the classroom as well. The staff and managers at every center were caring to the extreme. They used to babysit me at times, worrying how I might run into trouble or lose my way if I tried going to the nearby mall alone! Their concern was a general one for all foreign teachers. I did not need the hand-holding because I was a traveller to begin with but I could understand how some of the foreign teachers might have needed all this helping out. I think my lack of fuss made them love me all the more. I used to happily share the meals with them and expressed interest in learning about their language and culture. My favourite people in the entire episode were Mr. Bao and his wife Miss Doh (every woman is mysteriously called Miss in Vietnam). They were the caretakers of one of the centers that I had taught in and I shared meals with them and the center&amp;rsquo;s staff everyday. They spoke very little English, just a &amp;ldquo;Hello&amp;rdquo; or a &amp;ldquo;Thank You&amp;rdquo; or a &amp;ldquo;Bye&amp;rdquo;. But they loved to joke around with me and I sometimes shared a beer with Mr. Bao to end the day. They taught me how to pronounce different vegetables and meats by pointing and calling their names. Mr. Bao used to make fun of my chopstick skills and heaped up my bowl with extra rice whenever I asked him for a refill. It was little things like these that made me so happy to be around them. I did try learning Vietnamese but it is extremely tough to do so. I cannot form sentences yet but my pronunciation has improved. Vietnamese being a phonetic language, the pronunciation matters a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8137/29204156695_69da39e06e.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ho-nai-farewell-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;With Mr. Bao&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vietnamese teachers were also very interesting. Every batch had a regular Vietnamese teacher who sometimes attended my classes, either out of curiosity or to help me out with the beginner batches. I met quite a few of them but barely had a chance to interact with them outside the class. Most of them lived nearby with their families so they returned to their homes after the classes. There was one, Vincent (that&amp;rsquo;s his English nickname), with whom I shared a couple of beers and coffees and talked at length about world politics, a subject that he was deeply interested in. I got to know many things about India&amp;rsquo;s position in the world, how the relations between India and Vietnam were strengthening of recent and how India&amp;rsquo;s military technology was at a level where we are now exporting it. I also came to learn about how the socialist government of Vietnam was doing and what the people were happy and unhappy about. Then there were the cultural values that I was curious about; whether drinking was socially acceptable, the treatment of women and how generations contrasted when it came to love and religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met a few foreign teachers and it helped me understand a bit of their perspective as well. It was something radically different from what I had been expecting. I had been hoping to find travellers taking a break to replenish their savings before continuing on with their journey, but there were few of that kind. There were ones who were doing it as a long term profession and had been teaching in Vietnam for a while or planned to do so. It interested me to know about their reasons for favouring Vietnam over their own country. At times it was as simple as the weather or the better opportunity. At times it was the warmth of the people of Vietnam and the love that they found here. Sometimes it was the cost efficiency with the high income to expense ratio and at times it was some saddening blow that they had been dealt by life back home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-conclusion&#34;&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not think I can sum up all my experiences in a post and I would be doing injustice to the ones that I leave out if I mentioned some selectively. I have met some amazing people and seen talents in so many unexpected places; from the security guard who could play some wicked tunes on the harmonica to a student whose notebook was lined with exceptional anime doodling. There were students of all age who sometimes surprised me at being extraordinarily good at some difficult word games and there was the three year old who could recognise words by their spellings at his early age. I was pleasantly surprised so many times that I find the experience at par with travelling. I was experiencing people rather than sceneries but these were so much more beautiful and interesting to explore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To wrap up the long rant, the experience of teaching was much more than I had thought it would be. I was extremely excited about the job when I had landed it. However, within the first few days I had developed serious apprehensions and doubts about what I had committed to. Then I recovered and learnt how to be better and more enthusiastic about things and soak in all the energy and love around me. The transformation might sound spiritual and it probably was but I do not want to categorise it. All I can say for certain is that I learnt many things. A lot about the world and the people around me and much more about myself. Many of the kids liked me and I loved them all (yes, even the brats!). Whether I will do something like this again or not is an open question, but I loved every moment of it thus far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an album from my time at TBD in Vietnam. Some of the photos were taken from my phone due to the unavailability of my camera at the moment. Apologies for the same. 💩&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a series of buses from Hội An to reach Đà Lạt, a hill station known for it&amp;rsquo;s eternal spring weather. I was looking forward to this leg of my journey to get a respite from all the heat and humidity of the northern half of Vietnam. What I found was a city full of beautiful flowers and bewitching architecture, unexpectedly cold weather and warm people, oodles of hill station charms and an amazing blend of foreign and local tourists. Falling in love with this city was effortless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sweater-weather&#34;&gt;Sweater Weather&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bus reached Nha Trang early in the morning, around 5 AM. The connecting bus to Đà Lạt was at 7 AM so I dumped my bags in the office and rushed to the beach that was just two lanes away. It was still dawn and I hoped to catch a nice sunrise on an empty beach. Turned out, the entire city was to be found at the beach! There were people walking, jogging, doing aerobics and what not! The sea was also full of people enjoying a dip at this hour. I mean, who swims this early in the morning?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;instagram-media&#34; data-instgrm-version=&#34;7&#34; style=&#34; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;padding:8px;&#34;&gt; &lt;div style=&#34; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&#34;&gt; &lt;div style=&#34; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&#34; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/p/BHLToMsBysL/&#34; style=&#34; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;A photo posted by Karan (@grasskode)&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;time style=&#34; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&#34; datetime=&#34;2016-06-27T23:39:10+00:00&#34;&gt;Jun 27, 2016 at 4:39pm PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could not see the sun because of the clouds and gave up the task because I was getting hungry. I went around the block and ate a bowl of Pho. All the sign boards and shop names here were in Vietnamese, Russian and at times English. 😋 The Russian presence always makes itself felt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back to the Sinh Tourist office and waited a while for the bus to turn up. This one was a sleeper as well and I actually got some much needed sleep on this one, though I missed out on quite a lot of scenery. I kept waking intermittently to find the world around me changing. The plains gave way to hilly contours; the road was wavy and flanked by greenery; the rains imparted a cosy touch to it all. We reached Đà Lạt in a couple of hours since having started from Nha Trang. The city looked very pretty and we made our way to the bus company&amp;rsquo;s office. There was one small trouble though; it was raining continuously. I stood under a shelter at the office trying to figure out where I would stay. I had not booked a hostel thinking that I could walk around to find a place, but the rains were playing a spoilsport and I needed some more rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the rain let up a bit, I walked in a certain direction that seemed to have a few good hostels. The rains resumed shortly and I took out my poncho. I came upon the &lt;strong&gt;YOLO hostel&lt;/strong&gt; first and went in. They had a dorm bed available in a huge hall with mattresses laid out on the wooden floor. I liked the setup somewhat but they gave me the room for a price of the smaller dorm and some haggling around the agoda price. I decided to stay here just for the night. I kept my bags and worked a bit while I waited for the rains to ease. Then I went out to get something to eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was uncomfortably cold outside. I was not prepared for such a weather, neither mentally nor with my wardrobe. I would have to buy a sweater, but first, I had to eat! I crossed a small cafe near the hostel and took a look at their menu. The lady who ran the place pulled me in and I ordered a &lt;em&gt;Bun Cha&lt;/em&gt; at her suggestion. This lady was something of an eccentric character. She told me that the Bun Cha here was very different from Hanoi&amp;rsquo;s. Then she went to cook a fresh plate which took a while and once she came back with the food, she showed me several pictures of the food she had prepared throughout the day. 😝 The Bun Cha was somewhat different from Hanoi&amp;rsquo;s but I could feel certain similarities. In any case, my craving for the delicious dish simply refueled rather than being satiated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8252/29070217985_e505575ffc.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tu-anh-peace-restaurant&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Bun Cha (not quite) Hanoi&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked further after having filled my stomach a bit. An &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.travelfish.org/sight_profile/vietnam/central_highlands/lam_dong/da_lat/605&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easy Rider&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; fellow caught hold of me while I was walking about. I had heard so much about this service that I was curious enough to ask him what it was all about. He explained the concept to me. It is basically a motorbike tour to places in and around Đà Lạt. The customer rides pillion with the rider and the prices seemed to be pretty reasonable for the duration and the services offered. However, I was not much of a pillion rider, so I just thanked him for the information and went into another eatery that looked more local. I thought I ordered a &lt;em&gt;Bun Cha&lt;/em&gt; here as well, hoping to savour a more local taste of the same dish. But silly me did not know that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bun Cha Ca&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was much different from &lt;em&gt;Bun Cha&lt;/em&gt;. 😑 And so it was that I found another way that the Vietnamese do the noodle soup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8449/29070217225_abef28ec03.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bun-cha-ca&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Bun Cha Ca&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked around the roads after this, trying to trace a big circle back to the hostel. I think all the hill stations have similarly haphazard roads. There is very little planning that can be done in the mountainous terrain. I saw a peaceful Buddhist temple and a church. Then I walked around the roads lined with shops searching for a sweater to save myself from the chilling winds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8455/29037379266_6759c876eb.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;chua-linh-son-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Chua Linh Son&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw a shop that was selling sweatshirts for 100 kVND and went to check it out. The designs were not bad and the bargain seemed well worth it but I did not get any, deciding in favour of checking more options. I walked up to the main market. Right before the market building, there people selling clothes on the street; &lt;em&gt;Janpath&lt;/em&gt; style! 😆 I witnessed a scene where a police van&amp;rsquo;s approach sent everyone scuttling away and then they slowly resumed sales when the van went out of sight. I browsed through some jackets here as well. Not the best of quality but, once again, cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8025/28452401583_a75d5aea6d.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Đà Lạt-market-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;A stall at the market&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went into the market building and walked through it. There were better shops inside but I knew I was looking for a cheaper option. I went out the other side of the market building. There were lots of shops selling various items of daily need, dried food, fresh meals, flowers and plants, vegetables, tarts, jams and what not. I finally found a decent jacket worth 100 kVND in one of the street-side places. It was a flimsy thing, something of a stylish windcheater. I put it on and it did the job of keeping me warm. I ate a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bánh Tráng Nướng&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on my way out. This was the famous Vietnamese pizza, a local specialty, which was somewhat like an egg roll. It was good but not really a cheap snack that I had supposed it would be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Bánh Tráng Nướng - The Vietnamese Pizza&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked back to the hostel which was nearby and spent the rest of the evening indoors. It was raining outside and the blanket felt really cosy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;đà-lạt-on-foot&#34;&gt;Đà Lạt on Foot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up the next day and took a much needed bath before checking out. I had booked a cheaper room in another hostel that was a 15 minute walk away. I saw a place advertising &lt;strong&gt;Bun Cha Hanoi&lt;/strong&gt; on the way and obviously felt compelled to stop for a bite. 😅 I am such a sucker for that dish! But there is no &lt;em&gt;Bun Cha&lt;/em&gt; to be had that is as good as Hanoi&amp;rsquo;s. This one came pretty close but was not quite the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vietnam Tip #8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eat as much &lt;strong&gt;Bun Cha&lt;/strong&gt; as you can when you are in Hanoi! Trust me, it is the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new hostel was much better than the last one. The lanes that led up to the place had the typical touch of the alleys of a small hill town. I really loved the quiet location and the friendly staff. I was invited for lunch with them and their family and friends. I met two girls from Saigon, Mandy and Cindy, and talked to them a bit. I had little to eat because I was already somewhat full with the recent breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went out walking after the lunch and all through, I thought of how wonderful the hill towns were. There was so much love in the air here. One found couples walking hand in hand and it seemed so much in keeping with the mood of the place. It seemed as natural to the hills as is a man rushing about in a city. I encountered a short spell of rains and spent the time sitting in a cafe drinking some amazing coffee and writing. I resumed walking when the rains stopped and went till the &lt;strong&gt;Xuan Huong Lake&lt;/strong&gt;. It is quite a big lake and I walked around it clicking pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8029/28448996254_0f180da307.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;xuan-huong-lake-5&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Xuan Huong Lake&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turned into a park and walked through it to a palace which is now used as a guest house. Đà Lạt has some beautiful houses which were turned into hotels or restaurants. The architecture is charming and compliments the scenery really well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8192/28449206794_38d6afaeed.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;park-1&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Beautiful parks and buildings&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw more beautiful buildings and pretty flowers all the way till the Summer Palace, where I was headed to. The city was mesmerising and vast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;instagram-media&#34; data-instgrm-version=&#34;7&#34; style=&#34; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;padding:8px;&#34;&gt; &lt;div style=&#34; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&#34;&gt; &lt;div style=&#34; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=&#34; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/p/BHQp0PXBAp5/&#34; style=&#34; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;A photo posted by Karan (@grasskode)&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;time style=&#34; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&#34; datetime=&#34;2016-06-30T01:29:15+00:00&#34;&gt;Jun 29, 2016 at 6:29pm PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought a 15 kVND ticket to the &lt;strong&gt;Summer Palace of Bao Dai&lt;/strong&gt;. This was the kind of ticket fee that makes me a happy tourist. The palace was really nice. It was more of an open house with everything preserved the way it used to be when the royal family lived here; the bedrooms with their beds made up; the halls and sitting rooms with beautiful decor; the well maintained gardens. There was not much history to it but the house is pretty enough to contemplate the lives of it&amp;rsquo;s erstwhile residents. I walked around for a good long hour without getting bored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many more pictures of Bao Dai&amp;rsquo;s Summer Palace in the album at the end of the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked back to the hostel after seeing the palace. It was getting dark and I was somewhat tired from all the walking. I had planned to see the Crazy House but left it for another day. As I was crossing the main market, an older man called out to me and waved hello. Then he shouted something which I did not hear properly so he asked me to stop and made his way to me. I was expecting a sales pitch, perhaps another offer for an Easy Rider tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hello! Where are you from?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; he said with a smile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;India. Ấn Độ.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; I replied&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh! You speak Vietnamese?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;No no&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; I laughed. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Very little.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Okay. You a movie star?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;What? No!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;You very handsome. Haha!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; he laughed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I laughed in return and thanked him. I was expecting the sales pitch next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Okay then, bye.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoa! I asked him his name. Mr. Bean. 😂 I walked away amused. You gotta love the hills! I ate some Japanese snacks, Takoyaki, from a street side cart and drank some cold milk tea with jellies, Tra Sua. Then I returned to the hostel to rest and write a while.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Japanese Takoyaki be 💕&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went down to the common room later in the night. Everyone was jamming to some Vietnamese and English songs. I tried playing the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caj%C3%B3n&#34;&gt;cajón&lt;/a&gt; there but it was a little difficult as I did not know how those Vietnamese songs would progress. Mandy and Cindy were there and two Dutch siblings also came in, Rose and William. Rose had been interning at a nearby coffee plantation for the last 3 months and had recently finished. William had just joined her and they were planning to travel through Vietnam for a while before returning home. I enjoyed a couple of beers with everyone and then headed to the room to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;scootering-around&#34;&gt;Scootering Around&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rooster had been cock-a-doodling in the middle of the night. I had a tough time falling asleep and then I woke up to find everyone around me up and about. I thought it would be late in the morning but it was just 6:30 AM! I cursed under my breath and tried to sleep some more. I woke up again at 7:45 AM and found the room empty. I suspected that the mobile&amp;rsquo;s clock was off and checked my red watch which I had not been using for a while. It said 10:45! I had planned on going to Pongour waterfalls with the Dutch at 10 AM today. They might have left already and I needed to get going as well. So I got out of the bed and brushed my teeth. While I did my toilet, I realised that I had seen the stopwatch on the red watch which had been running for almost 11 hours for some reason. The time was still less than 8 AM in the morning. But there was no returning to sleep from this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went down around 9:30 AM and was given a coupon for free breakfast, something that I had not known about! The breakfast was in the hostel next door and the lady here, a good natured woman whom we called Mama, gave me a few options. I chose the bread, butter and jam with coffee. There were three more people at the table. An English-Canadian couple who were working in Dubai and a American woman who lived in Hawaii. I started talking to the American when she asked me &amp;ldquo;Hablas Espanyol?&amp;rdquo; No I did not, but I felt that this was the comparison that made the most sense. She had been to India and it was her favourite place. She was a &amp;ldquo;yogini&amp;rdquo; and a vegetarian which might be a reason for her profound love for India. I can see how our country is such a paradise for vegetarians. She asked me if I did yoga and I had to tell her that not every Indian did yoga and that the &amp;ldquo;world famous&amp;rdquo; yoga gurus were not so famous within the country. She expressed surprise as to how we could have given the world something so amazing and forgotten about it ourselves. I told her that our materialistic pursuits were far more important at the moment, but hopefully things would change soon. Anyway, I helped her plan her itinerary for her northward journey through Vietnam while we had breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rented a scooter from the hostel and joined the Dutch for Pongour Waterfalls. There are a few waterfalls around Đà Lạt and Pongour is the one farthest away and considered the more beautiful by some. The English-Canadian couple also joined us and we set out across the city. The English woman was riding their scooter and was having a little trouble coping with the Vietnamese traffic. But she was coping well and learning fast! We went slow and steady in order to stay together. The highway after the city was not much of a ride because a long part of it was under repair. There was a lot of dust and rowdy trucks that did not help the case. We finally left the highway for a more beautiful road that went through picturesque fields and led us to the waterfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Beautiful road to the waterfalls&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We bought the entry and parking tickets and walked the rest of the way after leaving the bikes in the parking lot. A few Easy Riders had also come in with their customers. Contrary to the jungle trail I had been expecting, it turned out to be a paved pathway all the way to the falls. There were a few small shops and eateries just before the falls. A barbed wire fencing around the pool and sign boards warned the visitors against getting into the water. I do not like such controlled places. How difficult is it to let nature be? This being the condition of the least touristy falls, I did not really want to go see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Warning Sign&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The falls themselves were beautiful though. The water cascaded down in steps and was pleasantly cold. Everyone was clicking pictures of the falls and themselves. I jumped about the rocks and decided to ignore the board asking people not to climb and went one level up into the falls. The view was even more beautiful from here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Pongour Waterfalls&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dubai couple left a little earlier than the rest of us. The Dutch and I left at the same time but they were going back to Đà Lạt and I planned to take an alternate route to the north-west of the town (we were south of Đà Lạt right now) before heading back to the hostel. Probably the most interesting part of this outing was talking to William. He had read a lot about India and wanted to go there. He said found India interesting. How so, I asked? He said it was because of the cultures, religions, how they treated their women, history, etc. I told him that what made India really interesting was how all those things were never the same but varied as per the given place, time and socio-economic class. He wanted to know about nature in India. I told him I found it much better than here. He was impressed by these falls so I guess it was much better than his part of Europe as well. Anyway, we said goodbye at the parking lot and I took the alternate route back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turned into a dirt track soon after leaving the falls. The dirt had turned into mud in the patches where the rain water had accumulated. The entire route went through such tracks and tarred roads of varying qualities. It also provided views to amazing countryside and rural sceneries. The locals were amused to see a foreigner on the off-road and smiled at me when I caught their curious stares. I went off track once when I followed the road, mesmerised by the beautiful buildings in the village, instead of turning into yet another dirt trail. But it was all an amazing and beautiful experience. I stopped at a random place to eat some &lt;em&gt;Com Binh Dan&lt;/em&gt; and it was here that I first had the amazing beef cutlet - &lt;strong&gt;Bo La Lot&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Off route highway and it&#39;s rewards&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second half of the journey had better roads. I was passing by Đà Lạt which lay on my east. The hills began soon enough and I hit upon patches full of greenhouses. Out here there was barely any ground to be seen on the slopes of the hills; there was the translucent white roof of the greenhouses that covered the entire landscape at times. At places, the hills were marked with the reddish muddy scars of where they had been cut out to make farms. It was interesting how these hills had been modified to suit the human need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My destination had been a certain spot marked on the map as Golden Valley. I got to the entry and paid 40 kVND for the ticket. I rode on to the parking and continued thereafter on foot. There were a lot of tourists here, mostly Vietnamese. There was a path leading up into the hills which I took first. The only term I have to describe the entire setup is : a big park. The hill had been turned into a big garden like setup with a flowing stream, wooden bridges, horses and costumes to get oneself pictures clicked with, flowers, shed, broken carts and many more beautifications of the vein! I walked to the top of the hill expecting to see something here but there was just a trickling pipe which was labelled as a &amp;ldquo;waterfall&amp;rdquo;. 😒 The lake was on the other side so I worked my way back down and headed towards it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8517/28783816690_0eca74c370.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;golden-valley-4&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Hill Garden&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The area around the lake was also heavily decorated. Flowery gardens, paddle boats, suspension bamboo bridge, pretty walkways and cafes. I personally do not like such made up nature but I could see the value in this. Đà Lạt was catering to a particular industry of local tourists, mostly couples and families. This is that intrigued them and I could see all of them happily spending time all over the place, clicking photos and enjoying their walks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Tourist attraction&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I was here, I thought I might just as well make the most of it. I went and sat in a bamboo shelter at the edge of the lake. I guessed that the &amp;ldquo;golden&amp;rdquo; in the name of the valley came because of the muddy waters of the lake. I rested a bit and observed the tourists all around. I also clicked some photos, trying as many angles as I could without leaving my spot. 😜 I headed back towards Đà Lạt when the sun was about to set behind the hills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city was close enough and I reached the hostel before it got dark. I returned the scooter and went out to eat. A particular place caught my nose with it&amp;rsquo;s amazing smell of barbecue and I went in. I had barbecued pork with rice, a simple and delicious meal. I was sharing the table with a young girl who showed me how to clean the cup and poured me some tea after the food. I thanked her and she kept giggling in reply. 😄 Kids!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Cơm Tấm Sườn Bì Chả&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also had a couple of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hot Dogs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; after dinner. This dish is not actually a hot dog but simply a toasted cake with cheese or chocolate inside. Since I had not had either cheese or chocolate in a while, I got one of each and munched on them on my way back to the hostel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8692/28964578312_9dbf4b5091.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;hot-dog&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;A different kind of Hot Dog&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guys were jamming and singing as usual in the common room and I sat with a beer. Some of them were planning to go to a bar nearby and I initially thought I would join them but later decided against it because I was too tired after the long day. I hit the bed a little later but stayed up to watch the Portugal vs Poland match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;đà-lạt-nights&#34;&gt;Đà Lạt Nights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had slept late because the match had gone into penalty shootouts. Then I woke up early again because everyone in my room was up and about. I did not get why everyone woke up so early every day! I struggled to sleep and eventually got out of bed &amp;ldquo;late&amp;rdquo; at 10 AM. I got some breakfast and moved to another hostel. I wanted to extend my stay by a day and the manager informed me that they were completely booked. She shifted me to a nearby hostel which was not too bad. There were just 4 beds per dorm and I was the only one in my room when I got there. I decided to head out to the supermarket near the lake after dumping my bags. I needed some basic ration and wanted to check out the peculiar looking place as well. My walk to the C-Mart went without much event; just a drunk man offering me some rice wine in the middle of the afternoon which I had to decline with emphasis. The supermarket was built entirely underground and the area above had been converted into a quirky looking public square. I took some pictures and then went in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went about the supermarket getting more things than I had initially planned to get. There were a couple of things that I wanted to take back to India which I got got here. I am a sucker for supermarkets anyway. I sat in the food court eating a &lt;strong&gt;Hu Tieu&lt;/strong&gt; and trying to stuff my shopping into my tiny bag. I managed it somehow and then headed back to the hostel to drop off my purchases. I had a roommate by the time I got there; a young boy from HCM. We exchanged hellos and I tried taking a bath in the broken down bathroom with a door that would not lock. I went out to a good cafe nearby to sit and drink some coffee and work a little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Work and Coffee (please don&#39;t judge the Windows 10)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back to Mama&amp;rsquo;s in time for some &amp;ldquo;family dinner&amp;rdquo; that I had been invited to. Everyone had already gathered by the time I reached. There were the Dutch and the couple from &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guernsey&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guernsey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It was amazing how I was coming to know about so many new nations. I had no idea about &lt;strong&gt;Channel Islands&lt;/strong&gt; before today. The food was quite delicious and I ate a couple of bowls of rice before calling it quits. The Dutch told me that they had gone to the cable car today and I told them that I had done nothing worthwhile all day. 😎 After dinner, I went back to the room to work some more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to Note Hostel around 9 PM. I grabbed a beer and talked to some young folks from the provinces around Đà Lạt who were on vacation here. They were trying to speak to me in their limited English and I was trying my best to understand and reply. There was the jamming and karaoke again. I liked the energy and enthusiasm. The Dutch were asked to sing a few songs first and then it was my turn. The guitarist and I did Lucky Ali&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;O Sanam&amp;rdquo;. I somehow managed to pull it off with my laughable vocal skills. 😁&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few of us decided to go to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g293922-d6948253-Reviews-100_Roofs_Cafe-Da_Lat_Lam_Dong_Province.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maze Bar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(or 100 Roofs Bar). We took a cab while we could have easily walked the distance, but the cab was cheap enough. This bar is one of the major tourist attractions of Đà Lạt and not without reason. It is really amazing. There are staircases going everywhere and the entire building is made like a maze. The pain and effort put into making the place is extremely evident. We grabbed a few drinks and sat in one of the corners to enjoy them. I got talking to the guy from Liverpool, Alex, who had come in earlier that afternoon. He used to be a mechanical engineer and had quit his job when he started travelling. He had been on the road for quite a while now. I also came to know that William and Rose were not twins as I had previously thought. Rose was just 20 and William was 5 years older to her. We finished our drinks while trying to guess the number of people in the bar at that moment. It was a difficult task because there was not a single seating area and we agreed on a number between 150 and 200.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;The Maze Bar&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went to another pub after this one. Linh, the Vietnamese staff from Note Hostel who was accompanying us, took a cab again while this was actually just a 5 minute walk! None other than Rose minded a lot though. There was live music here and it sounded a bit too loud to me initially. The drummer was high but extremely good. I eventually got myself a beer and we all enjoyed the band till it was time to close at midnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/8/7564/28964550962_2c8670ea08.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tourists&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Nightcrawlers&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We headed back to the hostel and made Linh walk the 600 meters despite his laziness. We talked about our favourite Vietnamese food on the way and said goodbye in front of the hostel. I went to mine and sat watching Wales crush Belgium in the Euro cup. This was one of the better matches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;unexpected-opportunity&#34;&gt;Unexpected Opportunity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had slept better today and woke up much more refreshed. There had been no cock-a-doodling in the middle of the night and no girls making a ruckus early in the morning. The young man from Saigon asked me if I wanted to join him for breakfast and sightseeing for the day. Unfortunately I was going to get the free breakfast and then planning to head out of Đà Lạt that day. It would have been interesting to walk around the town with him though. I went to get the breakfast and also booked a ticket to Mũi Né. Rose had suggested that I go to Vung Tau but there was no direct transportation from Đà Lạt. I would have to break my journey in Mũi Né and get another bus from there. I went to the market to withdraw some money from the ATMs and it is a very disturbing task at times. I tried an Eximbank ATM that did not work; then an Agribank did not work; and then a Vietcom refused transaction. The messages are so cryptic that it leaves you wondering whether the problem is with the bank or your card. Eventually the next Agribank worked and I sighed with relief. Then I walked hastily back to the hostel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dutch were also leaving that day. They were making their way northward. Everyone in the hostel killed some time taking photos. Then I checked out of the hostel and sat outside talking to everyone and waiting for the pickup for my bus. The Dutch left first and then Mandy handed me some pamphlets for an English Center that was looking to recruit foreign teachers. She was a manager in one of the centers. I asked her if I could apply. She told me that they preferred native English speakers or ones with some kind of certification but since she knew I had decent command over English, I had a chance. They required a minimum commitment of a month. I told her I would think about it and left it at that for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about it was all I did for the rest of the day. A guy came to pick me up on his motorbike when it was time for the bus. I forgot my jacket right outside the bus when I kept it on a scooter while handing out the ticket. I slept and discussed the offer out with Parul. This would mean serious alterations in my travel plans but it was something that was different from what I did and definitely excited me. I reasoned it as a new experience; I was doing this entire trip for the experiences, then why shut myself to this one just because I had made some travel plans? The bus stopped briefly at a small place for some overpriced food. I slept the rest of the way till Mũi Né. When the bus dropped me, I had made my mind to take up Mandy&amp;rsquo;s offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat near the bus service office to look for some viable lodging options nearby. The last bus to Vung Tau had already departed and I would have to stay in the town for the night. The options with better online ratings were seemingly fully booked. There was just one other girl at the office at this time. She was searching for a particular place where her friend was working. She told me that it was a really beautiful hostel right by the beach and they had dorms for 4 USD. I helped her out by offering my phone for her to talk to her friend. It was only after I had agreed that I found out that the place was 20 kms from the town and it would make no sense for me to go that far in the evening just to return early next morning. The girl was Athena, a Canadian with Asian genetics. She had sold her stuff back in Canada and planned to go live with her ex-roommate in Costa Rica, grow and sell weed there and then use the money to travel around. They could even marry so that he could work in Canada. I don&amp;rsquo;t know whether she will be able to do as she plans but that&amp;rsquo;s an interesting take on life. She had had a rough week with stuff getting stolen. She had also managed to leave her wallet on the bus and I sat talking to her while the bus returned with it. Then she went to withdraw some money and I decided to check out some cheap dorm options nearby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked into one that was advertising beds for 5 dollars. It turned out to be the same double room on a sharing basis setup. My roommate this time was an English guy from near Manchester. His name was Robert and he was doing south to north on a motorbike. I talked to him for a bit and then took a bath before heading out for some dinner and to enquire for rates to Vung Tau. This town had more Russian signs and the same pestering motobike drivers with their weed peddling offers. I was glad to be staying just a night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;The Russian Town&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also expecting there to be a sandy beach out here but there was just a concrete embankment and lots of sea food shops next to the sea. These seemed to be extremely popular with the local tourists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat in a cafe next to the hostel and troubled the tripping owner to make me a Ca Phe Sua Da. I chatted back home and did some writing before heading back to the room. Robert and his friends were smoking up outside. Mandy had replied to my message and I finalised a few things with her. My month long visa was about to expire so I needed to do a visa run before joining her center. The thing was that they wanted me to join as soon as possible, so I decided that I would head out straight to Cambodia and come back in a couple of weeks. I could always do Vung Tau and remaining southern Vietnam later. That settled, I got myself a bottle of beer and sat watching a boring Italy-Germany tactical match.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>

&lt;p&gt;It seems like I had been planning a solo backpacking trip overseas for ages. In late May 2016, I finally took off for a trip through South East Asia like I had always wanted to. I was dismissive of all deterring arguments. I cared not what was happening to me or around me. This trip was all that mattered right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a tourist bus from Huế to Hội An, the charming tourist town a little south of Da Nang. Hội An had come heavily recommended by everyone who had been to Vietnam. I usually approach such tourist towns with a speculative heart but the many reasons of Hội An&amp;rsquo;s popularity would become evident to me over the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;charming-hội-an&#34;&gt;Charming Hội An&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I forgot my hat in the bus when I got off at Hội An. 😕 This, I would remember only later in the night, though. I had not booked a place in Hội An because most of the online listings were somewhat expensive. I thought I would figure it out somehow when I got to Hội An. As I sat putting on my shoes at the bus stand (they make you take off your shoes in the buses), a nice woman walked up to me and offered me a room for 10 USD per night. I told her it was out of my budget and we finally settled at 6 USD a night for a &amp;ldquo;dorm room&amp;rdquo;. I rode with the woman and her little daughter on her bike to the home stay, &lt;a href=&#34;https://goo.gl/maps/S8fwBtkAXw92&#34;&gt;Gom Do&lt;/a&gt;, which was near by. She was amused to learn that I was from India. She said she was told she looked somewhat Indian, which she did; her name was Yum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guest house was nice but the room was not really a &amp;ldquo;dorm room&amp;rdquo;. It was basically a family room with three beds that they were renting out on a sharing basis. Worked for me. I was the first one in the room. There was also a catalogue for tours that I did not intend to take. After I had settled down and was preparing to go out to explore the city, they brought in another taveller. This was Lisa, a European who lived in Argentina and was somewhat surprised at finding the &amp;ldquo;dorm room&amp;rdquo; not quite as she had expected. She was somewhat uncomfortable with the arrangement and took some time to think through the idea. Since I was leaving, we just decided on the beds, protocol for leaving the keys, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a lift from one of the guest house staff on the way to the old town. I asked him to drop me at a nice place to eat and he left me at a street-side place that served &lt;strong&gt;Mì Quảng&lt;/strong&gt;, a Hội An specialty. It was pretty nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8728/28301512453_842715ea65.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;mi-quang&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Hội An food tour begins with a Mì Quảng&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked to the old town that was up ahead. The sun had set and the lights had come up. There were the famous tailor shops everywhere. Hội An&amp;rsquo;s specialty was very evident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8471/28299214514_899a6a41ae.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tailor-shop-3&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Clothes everywhere!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ancient city was lively with lots of lights and tourists. There were Chinese lanterns hanging all around and they looked beautiful in the narrow lanes with old buildings. There were a lot of cafes and restaurants and shops selling all kinds of interesting things like coffee, posters, coasters, souvenirs, etc. The ancient city has some kind of a ticket for entry which covers most of the temples and other sights in the area. I did not know about it so I just walked in. There was no one checking the ticket, in fact it would have been quite a task with so many tourists! I don&amp;rsquo;t think there is a point of taking the ticket at all unless you want to look at the temples and all the buildings with classic architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Charming ancient city&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I crossed the river on a crowded and lit up bridge. The other side had a street market and drinking holes as well. I was handed a flier for a free drink at a Monkey Bar. It was not very happening when I crossed it so I did not go in. There were many more bars and pubs, all of which were just beginning to see business for the night. I was not in the mood for a drink anyway so I contented myself with walking along the river. The whole place was really lively. There were people playing games and some Vietnamese street performances. There were vendors selling food items and souvenirs. Lots of beautiful Chinese lanterns as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked across the small island and sat along the Thu Bồn river on the other side. This place was quieter and I got a Ca Phe Sua Da while I wrote a little in my notebook. Eventually I started walking back. The market was still in full swing and everyone was enjoying their night. I saw the famous Japanese Bridge on the way; it was overflowing with selfie clicking tourists but pretty nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;VIDEO : Hội An nights&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply walking around is the thing to do in this town. I did that for a while but I was somewhat tired tonight, so I returned to the room and called it an early night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-bang-beach&#34;&gt;An Bang Beach&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up and had a simple breakfast at the guest house. I got to meet some interesting people at the table. There were two Chileans, Nidia and Khaviet, who were travelling together. They had been in New Zealand before this and had been away from home for a long time now. There was also a French woman in her middle ages who ran a guest house in Morocco. She had some interesting stories to tell about the Arab people and the business she was trying to set up in Cambodia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to go to the beach after the breakfast. Lisa was going out to meet her friends. I decided to walk the 5 odd kilometers to &lt;strong&gt;An Bang beach&lt;/strong&gt;. Nidia and Khaviet crossed me on their bikes just outside the town. I waved them goodbye and told them I might see them at the beach. The town had ended quite abruptly and the fields had replaced the buildings. This level of planning seems uncomfortably unnatural to me. There was a pretty canal running along the country road. I felt like jumping into the water to seek respite from the harsh sun. I was really missing my hat. 😫&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The road led to the main highway and I hastened to the beach. There were quite a few tourists going to or coming back from the beach on their bicycles. I could see just one man walking ahead of me. We caught up with each other and exchanged hellos right before the beach. He asked me where I was from and the conversation started thus. This was Robert from Malta. I blurted the first thing that came to my mind when he told me his country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1TnzCiUSI0&#34;&gt;The Italian Man who Went to Malta!&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;You know about that one, eh?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; he laughed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew that one by heart but I had never known that Malta was a small island country off the coast of Italy. We stuck together as we searched for a place on the crowded beach. The beach was much more beautiful than I had expected. We went past the beach chairs being sold and found a shaded spot under some plants to keep our bags in. The sun was blazing hot and the sea felt nice and pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert and I talked about a lot of things. He was an electrical engineer and was working for a company in London that made embedded products. He wanted to learn programming. He even told me they were looking for someone who coded in C and I could apply if I was interested. He compared how the cultures of London and Malta were different. We talked about food, Hindu religion, Shiva as a cool god, India for tourists and many more random topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Clicking in the sea&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got out of the water after having spent more than an hour in it. I had no idea that the sun can burn your skin even when you are submerged in water. Well, now I know. We decided to grab something to eat and a beer in one of the restaurants around the beach. I tried the &lt;strong&gt;Banh Vac&lt;/strong&gt;, also known as the white rose dumpling. It was delicious but not very filling, so I ordered a &lt;strong&gt;Cao Lau&lt;/strong&gt; as well, another Hội An specialty. Robert tried a grilled fish which was delicious and somewhat inexpensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Cao Lau&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We drank a couple of beers and talked some more. The &lt;strong&gt;brexit&lt;/strong&gt; result had just come out and Robert was a bit bummed as to what would happen to his employment terms. We speculated some and then simply shrugged our shoulders. Robert was planning to go back into the sea after the lunch but I had had enough. I bid him goodbye and headed back to the room in the blazing sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;lessons-in-partying&#34;&gt;Lessons in Partying&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a new guy in the room. This was Lisa&amp;rsquo;s Mexican friend, Juan. He was a cool guy and liked talking. We talked a bit about how every place has it&amp;rsquo;s own peculiarities. He lives in Mexico City and travels 20 kms to work everyday, which takes him 2.5 hours one way. I cannot imagine spending 5 hours in commute every single day! Lisa and Juan were heading out to meet friends and even I grabbed my bag and thought of heading to the old town to eat something more and then check out the pub the Chileans had told me about over breakfast that morning. But Yum caught me on the way out and told me about the &amp;ldquo;family dinner&amp;rdquo; that they were having at the guest house that night. Lisa and Juan had plans but they insisted that I say a yes, and so I did! There was just an hour to go for dinner time, so I decided to hit a cafe nearby. I killed the hour writing and chatting with a 4 year old who was speaking randomly in English. 😂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8107/28811706432_1ab1faf41b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;cafe&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Cuteness!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I returned to the guest house by 7 and helped Yum set the dinner table. There were more people in the guest house than what I had expected. There were two Dutch Girls (Hannah and Anna Marie), two Dutch Guys (Shtein and Khaish), two Irish guys (Pierce and Ronan) and the Chileans from the morning. And then there was me, the only person not traveling with a mate. Yum and some other Vietnamese staff joined us and we ate some delicious home made food. We talked a lot and then Shtein brought out his guitar. He played really good and so we asked for some beers and sang lots of songs. They wanted to hear a Hindi song, so I tried the first one that comes to my mind when a guitar is around - &lt;em&gt;Dooba Dooba&lt;/em&gt;. Shtein managed to get the chords right and we somehow managed the song. 🎸&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We partied till 10 in the guest house; we had to end early because it was a home stay in the middle of a residential area. But we decided to continue the party in a pub. We went to the same one that I had got a flier for the previous day - &lt;strong&gt;Funky Monkey&lt;/strong&gt;. All, except the Chileans who had left when the jamming had started, stuffed themselves in a taxi and left for the old town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8400/28917071265_756831320f.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;clubbing-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Funky Monkey&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funky Monkey was &lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt;. It was not all that crowded and you could put on your own songs, which the Dutch people did. We drank and danced. The Dutch really know how to let their hair down. They are not bothered by how they are dancing or what steps look &amp;ldquo;cool&amp;rdquo;.  They taught me some funny steps which I probably do not remember anymore; we smoked a hookah; drank rum and coke and were given 1+1. It turned out to be much more fun than I had thought it would be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8839/28631835580_87040ec4b2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;clubbing-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;The gang&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had to stop around 12 though when the pub closed its doors. The Dutch guys were supposed to drive to Huế in the morning so we said goodbye to them. Khaish, who looks weirdly similar to &lt;a href=&#34;http://img01.static.images-di.se/SiteImages/2016/01/17/thumbnails/p_zlatan-1169.jpg&#34;&gt;Zlatan Ibrahimovich&lt;/a&gt;, was pretty drunk and gaily kissed me goodbye. He told me something about &amp;ldquo;no borders&amp;rdquo; that I wanted to remember but cannot. However, the party had not ended yet for the rest of us. A man roped us in for another pub. He arranged motorbike drops to this place and we were probably the only ones in this pub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8796/28631832190_7b2beb27cd.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;clubbing-3&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Everything was hazy by now 😝&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a pool table and we started playing. Everyone was drunk and the Irish were hitting on the Dutch. Ronen took me aside and told me he had a chance with the blonde one who I was playing a match with. I happily stepped aside and let him play to which he told me I was his new favourite mate. 😂 I played with the bartender after they finished. She beat me two games in a row though they were extremely close. I bought her a drink to show my appreciation for beating a drunken me. I played a little foosball with Ronen and then we left for the guest house. 3 motorbikes. I was with a ladyboy I think but people&amp;rsquo;s genders or sexualities do not really make me uncomfortable. We got to the guest house and the man who was the ringleader wanted 100k per bike! I handed a 20k bill for mine and told him that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t drunk enough to pay any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lisa was on the top of the gate when we reached. She and Juan had reached just then as well and had found the gate locked. I showed them the key which was kept where we had discussed with the guest house owners and we laughed about it a bit. Everyone sat around and talked in hushed tones once we were all in. I was decently drunk so I left for the room and sat talking to Juan inside. He had travelled to Nepal as well - Kathmandu and Everest base camp. Somehow the topic of my marriage came up again and I explained it to him as I had done to so many already. He kept laughing throughout. 😐 My head was spinning and I passed out soon after. It must have been 4 in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-day-in-da-nang&#34;&gt;A Day in Da Nang&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up around noon next day with a headache and a terrible hangover. My room mates had a good laugh about it when they came back from the beach. I decided to cure my condition by taking a walk to find some food. I walked till &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g298082-d4308916-Reviews-Madam_Khanh_The_Banh_Mi_Queen-Hoi_An_Quang_Nam_Province.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madame Khanh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a small place which is famous for it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Bánh Mì&lt;/strong&gt;. Hội An has the best &lt;em&gt;Bánh Mìs&lt;/em&gt; in Vietnam and Madame Khanh does a really good one. She is an old lady who is as much of a tourist attraction herself as her sandwiches. One of her sandwich and a Ca Phe Sua Da eased my hangover by various degrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8646/28811705622_3fe17b4692.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;madame-khanh&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Cure for a hangover&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had just walked into the ancient town when I got Daniel&amp;rsquo;s ping on my phone. He and his friend were planning to catch a Vietnamese League football match in Da Nanag. He asked if I was interested and I said I was. I asked him when the match was. It was at 5 PM that evening! I checked the time; 2 PM. I rushed back to the local bus stand, which was a little before the guest house I was putting up in. I took the shortest route shown by Google Maps and in keeping with shortest routes, this one went through some quaint parts of the town. A real old town with old buildings and no tickets. There were some farms as well and at the end of the road, the bus stand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8406/28917065125_7734cb07e9.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;farms-3&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Farms en route to the bus stand&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a bus waiting when I got to the stand. I got in and the bus started in 15 minutes or so. It took the bus 40 minutes to get to Da Nang. This was the Bus Number 1 that is so notorious all over the online forms for overcharging foreigners. I don&amp;rsquo;t think the westerners get the concept of cheap bus travel. The ticket is for the passenger only. Any considerable luggage fetches an extra price, both, from foreigners as well as locals. I paid the usual 20 kVND and faced no problems whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Da Nang I got off a little before the stadium to try a few ATMs before walking to the stadium. I met up with Daniel and his friend, Andy, next to the stadium. They had already bought their tickets and I got mine as well. The tickets were being sold in black all over the place with the policemen standing in indifference. I got a 25k ticket for 30k; in 90 INR I had got the best tier ticket. 😄 This was one of the cheapest tickets I have ever purchased!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8752/28917064305_c3633dc89c.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;danang-stadium-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Chi Lang Stadium&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was still time for the match so we sat drinking beer in a shop right opposite to the entrance. There was a brief and heavy rain which let up just in time for the match. We talked about the &lt;strong&gt;brexit&lt;/strong&gt; mostly. These guys, both British, thought it was a stupid decision for the UK to exit the EU. There might be some good reasons to exit the EU but this decision was made for all the wrong ones. Also, the referendum had shown that the English were the only ones who wanted to exit. The Scots and Irish had wanted to remain in the EU and now there was a possibility of them exiting the UK to remain in the EU. Otherwise there needed to be a checkpoint between Ireland and Northern Ireland which would strain the peace treaty between the nations. They said that the trade might suffer as well. I pointed out that there were other nations that were not a part of EU but had trade agreements with them; Switzerland for example. But Switzerland was not a good place for working class people, they explained. We discussed implications like lack of skilled workers, the problem with restricted movement, lack of environmental and economic regulations. There were many things that they found bothering and this was one decision that would probably not be reversed till it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it was time, we picked up some 10k &lt;em&gt;Bánh Mìs&lt;/em&gt; and went into the stadium. There was not a &lt;strong&gt;huge&lt;/strong&gt; crowd but the stadium had a considerable audience. The seats were alright and we had a nice view of the entire ground. Da Nang in orange was playing Hải Phòng in white. Da Nang was third in the V.League table and Hải Phòng were the current leaders. The match had it&amp;rsquo;s thrill. They played the Vietnamese national anthem at the beginning of the match. People stood up and continued doing whatever it was that they were doing; smoking a cigarette, or texting; I continued eating my sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;VIDEO : Moments from the match&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The match itself was quite interesting. The quality of football was much better than I had been expecting. There were a few good moves. Jersey number 99 of Da Nang scored twice and Hải Phòng lost their momentum. One of the Hải Phòng player was shown a red card as well. The match was an enjoyable experience; one that I would repeat gladly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We split up after the match. The guys were staying in Lang Co which was a little north of Da Nang and looked pretty in the pictures. Daniel told me to hit him up if I was ever returning to Saigon. I rushed to see if I could still find a bus. It was already 7 PM. The buses stop around 6 PM apparently. I considered hitchhiking but how was I to know which car or bike was heading to Hội An? I was certainly not getting a 300k taxi. I decided to stay in Da Nang and hop cafes and watch the Euro matches before taking an early bus out to Hội An. There was time for the matches to start so I went to the riverside and walked along the promenade. Da Nang is one of the prettiest cities I have ever seen. I really liked the lights and the lack of any kind of rush that one sees in a city so big.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8659/28299220254_0058839ee7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;danang-lights-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8654/28841246041_b506c93cf6.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;danang-lights-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Bright lights, big city!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took some photos and then dived into the maze of roads again. I found a place to eat and got some Pho for dinner. The match had started by the time I ended my dinner and I decided to find a cafe to sit and enjoy the match in. This turned out to be quite a challenge. The street-side cafes that are omnipresent elsewhere in Vietnam seemed to be a rarity in Da Nang (at least in the part of the city I was in). I had to walk all the way back to the stadium to find a place and I missed the first 25 minutes consequently. Even this cafe was going to close at 10 PM. So much for my cafe hopping plans!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the match went into overtime, I decided to check out a hostel nearby. This one was offering me a free drop to Hội An in the morning. I got to Funtastic Hostel and talked to the manager over phone since the guy at the reception did not speak English. I explained the situation to him telling him that I wanted to spend the night but did not have my passport on me. I could mail him a scanned copy though, which I did and we decided on a price close to agoda&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I sat in the common room watching the rest of the matches while the staff snored away next to me. I was the only one up to watch football this late in the night. After the matches I went to my bed only to find it occupied by someone. I woke up the staff to ask him if there was another bed I could sleep in but he did not understand my request. He went into the room, switched on the lights and started creating a havoc that would have woken everyone up. I told him to quit it and that I would sleep in the common room instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I slept for the few hours before the hostel woke up. I was somewhat frustrated with the night&amp;rsquo;s mix up and the unapologetic nature of the manager and staff in the morning. It is at times like these that I regret not having booked through agoda or some place where I could share my experience with a bad review. Anyway, I availed the excuse for a free breakfast and took the drop to Hội An.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;coffee-and-memories&#34;&gt;Coffee and Memories&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was just another girl from this hostel. She was one of the rare Germans who do not have a thick accent. The van stopped at the beach-side franchise of the same hostel and loads of people got in. There were three groups, out of which two were from Canada. They got talking and the rest got listening. One was a couple of law students. The girl, who was doing most of the talking, was English by her accent, had been in Canada for 5 years and &amp;ldquo;never want[ed] to leave!&amp;ldquo;. Her voice was overspilling with the arrogance that I find utmost irritating. She was full of despise for the people of China and Vietnam. The other group was of two guys, one of whom did most of the talking. He was studying in Canada as well. These are the kind of people who are surprised and irritated at finding 20 people in a line at Shanghai airport. I pray they never come to India. A dialogue went as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There were 20 people waiting and those guys did not open another security post!&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;20? Really?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s why we always take the express check-ins.&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;Fuck your money! Really!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason this irritated me to no end. It was economic casteism, at it&amp;rsquo;s best, being paraded in front of me. I could have expressed my disdain but I reasoned that it would have been pointless to educate their elite western ego. I held my tongue and suffered the rest of the journey, which fortunately, was not long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a drop close to the hostel. As I walked the rest of the way, a few Vietnamese children started an impromptu conversation with me. They were from a province nearby and were here on vacation. Their guardian stood smiling a few steps behind as I exchanged names and shook hands with the children. I adore such confidence in kids so young, mostly because I remember having very little at their age. I still suffer from lack of confidence when it comes to talking to people at random but I am working on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I got to the guest house, I found that Lisa had left and Juan was highly amused as to where I had been missing all night. Yum told me later that he had expressed concern to her as well. Good man. 😊 I apologised and reiterated my story for his benefit. He &amp;ldquo;pfft&amp;rdquo;ed as he usually did and laughed it off. Then he left for the beach and I for the old town. I wandered around hunting for a good deal for a bus ticket to my next destination. Nothing felt right. I wound up on the riverside road in the old town and the music in one of the cafes caught my attention. Unlike the others, no one was calling out to me from inside. I walked up to take a look at the menu before the woman inside took notice of me and asked me to come in. There was just another old man sitting there who turned out to be the owner of the cafe. I ordered a Ca Phe Sua Da and sat listening to old French ballads, watching the people pass by on the road in front and the river beyond. It was quite beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old man, Mr. Kim, eventually asked me where I was from. He smiled when I told him I was from India and then produced a register at a page where another Indian had written something. I could not read since it was in Malayalam (I am guessing since the man had mentioned Kerala in his signature). Then I flipped through the pages and read random memories from people who had visited this cafe over time. The coffee and the memories registered in these pages complimented each other wonderfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;A perfect mix&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a bit I started working on my laptop and ordered something to eat. A younger man came in and started playing Chinese Chess with Mr. Kim. The game seemed pretty cool and Mr. Kim was killing his opponent. I looked around at the obviously photoshopped images of his younger self with some French men. The woman put a register in front of me when I finished my meal. These guys had a very unique way of keeping reviews. In a world where tripadvisor was the word of truth, and this is specially true for Hội An where every cafe flashes it&amp;rsquo;s tripadvisor rating to draw customers in, this cafe was doing it in the old school way. I wrote my review and ordered another coffee as a new round of Chinese Chess started at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g298082-d1121821-Reviews-Cafe_des_Amis-Hoi_An_Quang_Nam_Province.html&#34;&gt;Cafe Des Amis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were more people who were coming in and the woman was growing impatient with me. The cafes in Hội An are somewhat weird. They are not the usual cafes where you can sit and work at leisure. There seems to be a pressure to either give a constant business or be gone. Anyway, I left after the coffee and walked back to the hostel while booking a bus ticket en route. I spent some time in the guest house working on a blog post. Juan came in from the beach and was planning to go meet some of his Spanish friends in the old town. I headed out for some Pho and then caught a Euro match in the town&amp;rsquo;s Man U Cafe. I think they have one of those in every village. 😂 I went back to the room and slept early to make up for last night&amp;rsquo;s misadventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;southward&#34;&gt;Southward&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up the next day and watched the Copa finals with Juan. The referee played spoilsport and handed out two unnecessary reds. It did not seem like a football match anymore. Everyone ran around tired, missing passes and shots. It was a pathetic final, undeserving of the amazing competition that the Copa had been thus far. The match went into penalties. The big names missed their chances and Chile won on penalties for the second year running against the same opponent. Messi announced his &lt;a href=&#34;http://grasskode.xyz/post/rant/mexit/&#34;&gt;retirement from international football&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had breakfast in the guest house and talked to Yum a bit about tourism in Hội An. Incredibly, there was a time when tourists were not able to find places to stay in Hội An. The government had then started encouraging home stays. Anyway, I checked out and payed the bill which was not as hefty as I was expecting. I saw a small kitten near the reception while I was walking out. It was so little that it was difficult to spot on the floor!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8636/28917052175_c5fde4a8c7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;kitten-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Unfortunately I am not a cat person&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dropped my bag at the &lt;strong&gt;Sinh Tourist&lt;/strong&gt; office and went to look for a cafe to sit and work in. I sat in a large and spacious one with lots of open green space. Despite there being no customers around, I was rushed here as well. I walked out after my second coffee because my laptop was running out of battery and there was no power point to be seen. I walked back to the bus company office and ran into Juan right in front of it. He was also leaving the city today and had his bus out later that evening. He, however, had used his time better to do some sightseeing in the old town. He showed me some pictures he had taken and then we said goodbye once more. I sat in another cafe to charge my laptop, eat some noodles and drink a strange chilli-mango smoothie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was eventually time to cramp myself up in another bus. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how people taller than me, and there are plenty of them, travel in these things. I slept, worked and watched football through the night as the bus made it&amp;rsquo;s way southward to Nha Trang.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>

&lt;p&gt;It seems like I had been planning a solo backpacking trip overseas for ages. In late May 2016, I finally took off for a trip through South East Asia like I had always wanted to. I was dismissive of all deterring arguments. I cared not what was happening to me or around me. This trip was all that mattered right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is about when I got to Huế in central Vietnam. I took a train from Dong Hoi. Huế was the last imperial capital of Vietnam as well as one of the border towns in the north south civil war. It has a lot of history to it and some specialty cuisines as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;hues-of-huế&#34;&gt;Hues of Huế&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked out of the station after saying goodbye to Bibi and Miss Han. Google Maps showed that the hotel I had booked was just 1.5 kms away so I did not even consider the many &lt;em&gt;xe om&lt;/em&gt; drivers offering me a drop. Huế seemed like a lively town. It was lit up and people sat in restaurants and cafes enjoying food and drinks. I liked the vibes of this place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8297/28877706956_13400247cd.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;hue-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Lively colours of Huế&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to the hostel quickly enough. It was immediately south of one of the hospitals, well before the backpacker district. I had booked a single room that was falling in my budget. It had been a while since I had spent some time in the comfort of having no one around. I gladly accepted this break from hostels and all their activity and socialising. I am not a very social person to begin with. Anyway, since I was getting a single room with good reviews at a fraction more than what a hostel dorm would have cost me, I was up to spending a night in my preferred style!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hotel, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.agoda.com/bien-khoi-hostel/hotel/hue-vn.html&#34;&gt;Bien Khoi&lt;/a&gt;, was a little off the spot marked on Google Maps but a local helped me find it. This was a new hotel; just 30 days new. The woman at the reception barely spoke any English but one of her friends helped us out. I made more use of the Google Translate app as well. The narrow stairway led me to the third floor where my room was. It seemed nice and simple. It even had a balcony which I used just once during my stay. All in all, I would say, I had got a good bargain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8230/28804037512_80e1334df7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bien-khoi-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Private room!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quickly took a bath and went out to get something to eat. It was getting late and Vietnam&amp;rsquo;s more local food joints tend to close early. I got &lt;em&gt;cơm chiên&lt;/em&gt; (fried rice) from a restaurant and then went ahead to check out the backpacker district which Michaella had told me about. The lights got brighter and the streets livelier as I approached the area. The &lt;em&gt;xe om&lt;/em&gt; and cyclo riders also started pestering me. They offered me everything from opium to prostitutes. I went into my WTF mode. I had gotten into the habit of politely refusing any offers made to me but there were so many of them here that I quickly learnt to ignore. Then there were some that tried to get your attention in any possible way. One of the &lt;em&gt;xe om&lt;/em&gt; riders rode for 50-80 feet along my side constantly talking to me and showing me a packet of marijuana that he thought would interest me. Smacking him across the face would have interested me but I refrained for the fear of prolonged engagement. I walked straight out of the area, ditching my previous plan to grab a drink somewhere. I understand that people like to party and I have nothing against them or those who facilitate it in any way, but I do not understand why they cannot leave alone the ones who don&amp;rsquo;t want to join in! Anyway, the offers by cyclo and motorbike riders continued for a bit and then stopped when I had put enough distance between myself and the ghetto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8853/28293574093_65144cd0d7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;hue-riverside-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Riverside&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked to the river side and walked along the empty street. The shops had closed down and there was barely any tourist to be seen. A few artists were engaged in creating amazing pieces that they would sell at unjustified low prices the next day. I preferred such peace and quiet more than the loud tourist areas. I walked around a bit before heading back to the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/140507143@N02/28293540173/in/album-72157671174977510/&#34; title=&#34;woodart&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8788/28293540173_b38f1cdc62.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;woodart&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;imperial-capital&#34;&gt;Imperial Capital&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a really peaceful sleep and woke up late the next day. I decided to stay another night in this place and talked to the hotel manager about a suitable price. We agreed on the one agoda was listing. I am really curious about how that site works. Most of the hotels demand a higher rate when I ask them either for an extension or if I simply walk in to book a bed. One would have thought that agoda would be the more expensive of the two since there might be some service fee involved but it has never been so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I went out and looked for one of the more famous &lt;strong&gt;Bún bò Huế&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://goo.gl/maps/a2VWoHhi49K2&#34;&gt;shops&lt;/a&gt;. This dish is, as the name makes obvious, a specialty of Huế. It is the classic &lt;em&gt;Bún bò&lt;/em&gt; noodle soup done in the imperial style of Huế. I found the place and relished a large bowl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8327/28623881130_d75bd92c8a.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bun-bo-hue&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Kevin hearts Bún bò Huế&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I went to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g293926-d1121808-Reviews-Mandarin_Cafe-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html&#34;&gt;Mandarin Cafe&lt;/a&gt;, one of my wikivoyage discoveries. I am really glad of having gone to this one. The owner is a photographer and there are many excellent photographs of Vietnam on display. They are up for sale if any interests you. I had a banana pancake and a coffee and inquired about the rates of the buses to Hội An. Then I picked up the map of the walking tour, the real reason I had gone to the Mandarin Cafe. The map and advice for the walking tour were free of cost. They even gave me a nice post card compliments of the restaurant. 😀 I like such traveller friendly places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8261/28877697256_b8baf3ace9.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;banana-pancake&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;On the banana pancake trail&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huế was the last imperial capital of Vietnam. It was also a main player in the civil war that brought about the socialist revolution. The &lt;strong&gt;Perfume River&lt;/strong&gt; runs through the city and while most of the hotels and backpacker areas are south of the river, the north has the picturesque old city with a walled citadel. The walking tour map traced a nice route through the old city and gave a short history of every place of interest that would lie on the route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I crossed the &lt;strong&gt;Trường Tiền&lt;/strong&gt; bridge to the other side of the Perfume River which was pretty wide. The sun was not too hot and that made for a pleasant walk. I turned into one of the roads and entered the citadel through one of the many gates. There was the first layer of moat here and the wall was an impressive 8 meters wide fortification. It reminded me of the old Indian cities like Jaipur, just much less crowded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7751/28293572343_e907e63bd8.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;truong-tien-bridge-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Crossing the river&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Entering the citadel&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;War Museum&lt;/strong&gt; was up first but I seemed to have come in at the lunch hours. I decided to go ahead and come back for the museum if I felt like it. There were huge fighter jets and artillery guns on display that memorialized the civil war of Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8018/28623878310_38716618d5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;war-museum-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Passing the War Museum&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to the Imperial Museum next but it required a ticket which was the same as the one for the Imperial Palace. I walked along the southern wall of the palace complex and came upon the ticket counter, only to decide against buying the ticket. It cost a dear 150 kVND and I was not sure I wanted to see another palace. I assumed palaces are all similar inside; bedrooms and meeting rooms and halls for entertainment. I would have been interested in the Imperial Museum but there was no separate ticket for it. So I decided to forget all about the palace and the museums and enjoy the walk in the citadel. There was a big flag right opposite to the grand entrance of the palace and the two entrances to the citadel right next to the flag were flanked by big cannon guns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8828/28623876300_d846483412.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;flag-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8608/28804033942_9f94f62600.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;guns-3&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Big flag and big guns&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked along the well shaded pathways on the outside of the palace moat. The moat was full of lotuses, flower that I had fallen in love with. I had not seen many lotuses in India and I had never seen ones as beautiful as I was seeing here. Incidentally, lotus is the national flower of Vietnam as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other side of the street had a variety of shops; mostly clothes, bikes and daily needs. I did the southern and western walls and then took the by-lanes into the more residential parts of the citadel. There was a lotus plantation of sorts and impressive street art to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8593/28877678986_e8dbb7e250.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;streetart-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Streetart!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I walked back to exit the citadel from the Eastern side, I ran into a wholesale market of electric appliances, fabric, motorbikes and what not! Outside the citadel was the more famous local market - &lt;strong&gt;Cho Dong Ba&lt;/strong&gt;. They had everything one could ask for. The back lane even had specialty shops for eggs and bananas!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8629/28291339274_215e5f6ab1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;market-5&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Most unexpected specialty shops&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked back across the river over the Trường Tiền Bridge and went to the Church that marked the end of the walking tour. I decided to head back to my room, which was close by, to cool down and rest my tired legs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;culture-exchange&#34;&gt;Culture Exchange&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to try some local food and I looked some places online and decided on a particular road to explore. I went to a more busy joint at the end of this road, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g293926-d3809346-Reviews-Hanh_Restaurant-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html&#34;&gt;Hanh Restaurant&lt;/a&gt;. This place was full of locals, which is always a good sign. It looked a little more expensive than my usual choices but I decided to sit myself down. The rice wraps were the snack of choice all around me but I was not in the mood of that one again. So I ordered a couple of new snacks from the menu. The waiter helped me choose them and offered to bring me half a plate of each. When the snacks came, he also explained how they were eaten. I liked the rice pudding one (Bánh nậm) but did not like the shrimp tapioca thing (Bánh bột lọc) all that much. I topped off the snacks with a glass of delicious fruit yoghurt (fruit &lt;em&gt;lassi&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8707/28804025282_165d969dd7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;banh-nam&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Bánh nậm&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I went to the parks and walking street along the river. This place had it&amp;rsquo;s share of people. Huế seemed to attract a lot of Vietnamese tourists as well. I was walking along the street taking pictures of the Trường Tiền Bridge when a young girl walked up to me and started talking. She was a student and wanted to practice her English. Could I spare a few minutes to help her out? Of course I could! We sat next to the river and she started asking me the usual questions that must have formed her repertoire for foreigners. Where was I from? How long had I been in Vietnam? Where all had I travelled? I asked her some questions as well. Her name was Gau and she was from Hội An. She was studying medicine in Huế. She told me, as I was to find out in a few days myself, that Hội An was famous for cheap and good quality clothes. She did not know what Huế was famous for. She was in the fifth year of her six year course. It took money or family connections to have a good career in Vietnam. She said she might just start a private practice after completing her education. Another friend of hers, An, joined us later. They knew that India had tropical climate like Vietnam&amp;rsquo;s. But did India have snow? I told them it did, high up in the mountains. They were quite fascinated by snow, having never had seen it. Vietnam did not have snow in any part of the country. Once we had exhausted the possible list of questions, I expressed my desire to continue walking and we said goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8150/28293542683_a7f769b7d8.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;truong-tien-bridge-4&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Trường Tiền lights up&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must have walked barely fifty steps when another girl came up to me with a similar request. I nodded in agreement. I could not think of a better way to spend my evening. I sat down with her and another male friend of hers and we started talking. Another guy with pretty good English joined us later. These were Loan, Hom and Lin, in that order. The starting questions were done and dusted soon enough. Hom was studying law and we talked about the economies of our countries, the taxes and other similar things. He said he thought I was friendly and smiled a lot. I think that is one of the most important things I have learnt on this trip. They were impressed by my pronunciation of Vietnamese words, which is not at all an easy task for foreigners. They wanted to know how I found the traffic in Vietnam, another thing that the foreigners usually struggle with. I shrugged my shoulders and told them that this was nothing compared to what we had in India. 😎 Lin wanted to know why the women in India wear a red spot (&lt;em&gt;bindi&lt;/em&gt;) on their foreheads. Loan wanted to know why we use our right hands in particular to eat. Then we got around to the subject of patriarchy. Vietnam has made long strides towards equality of genders. The men and women share the work outside and inside households. Loan told me that she had come to know that Indian men came back from work and did nothing while the women worked, cleaned and cooked. Much to my shame, I told her that it was quite true. But things were changing slowly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shoutout&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop being chauvinist pigs. Those of us who travel do not like to be put into embarrassing positions because of your stupidity. 😒&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what about religion? I told them that our predominant religions were Hinduism and Islam. Vietnam&amp;rsquo;s were Buddhism and Christianity, though there was an increasing number of non-religious people in Vietnam. In fact, Vietnam is one of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://humannationalityvn.blogspot.com/2015/11/the-chaging-trend-of-religions-in.html&#34;&gt;most non-religious&lt;/a&gt; countries in the world. Out here, they called these non-religious people &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo;, which, as per me, was a very apt way to put it. These guys were free; I told them that so was I. 😇&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked around some more after leaving the three. It had been an interesting day and I was starting to like the town a little despite the irritating cyclo and motorbike riders. I ate &lt;strong&gt;Cơm Bình Dân&lt;/strong&gt;, the commoner&amp;rsquo;s rice, that night. It was simply rice with an assortment of vegetables and meat. Cheap and filling as I like it. I ended the meal with a mango smoothie before heading to the room for another night of peaceful sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8711/28877646856_c6e22b399e.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;com-binh-dan-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Typical Cơm Bình Dân stall&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;royal-tombs&#34;&gt;Royal Tombs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I changed to a new hostel after waking up. I went back to the Bún bò Huế place on the way and ate a bowl for breakfast. The new hostel seemed quite nice. It was outside the backpacker area and so there were less people around and I got my quiet. I rented out a bicycle for a nominal charge of 1 USD and took it for a ride. This was a city bike without gears and the roads turned out to be a bit challenging as soon as I left the city. I was planning to do a few royal tombs around town today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I headed to the &lt;strong&gt;Tomb of Tự Đức&lt;/strong&gt;, the one that was closest to the city. I rode on the main highway for some time before diving into the country roads. Google Map led me through quaint alleys before dropping me at the entrance of the tomb. It looked like a modest complex with a few shops that had set themselves up in front of the ticket counter. They invited me to avail free parking in their premises but I chose to pay the nominal 2 kVND parking for a cycle instead of risking a misunderstanding later on. The ticket to the tomb turned out to be a 100 kVND affair. I shook my head and bought the ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first building was the living quarters of Tự Đức and later became his temple. Tự Đức was the last emperor who enjoyed real power in Vietnam; he was followed by puppet kings installed by the French. This was his holiday palace, something of a retreat. The house was in the typical style of the old structures (temples and schools) I had seen in Hanoi. There was the courtyard and a backyard. The entire complex was pretty and big. It was interesting how the emperor had lived in utmost, though not overt, luxury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8785/28908984465_f122fbdb3a.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tu-duc-temple-6&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Tự Đức&#39;s temple&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a lake in front of the building and an islet in the middle of it. It used to be populated with exotic birds and animals; the emperor enjoyed boat rides and walks there. Now there were just withering lotuses in the lake and lots of workers working on some project to beautify the islet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8683/28293550533_52bf150a8f.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tu-duc-complex-lake&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Lake and islet&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The living quarters had a throne room where you could rent out &amp;ldquo;royal&amp;rdquo; clothes and sit on the throne or palanquin to take pictures. 👑 📷 😅&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Royal palanquin&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was also a small sales counter for some impressive local art. Vietnam has the most beautiful quality of local artwork I have seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next building was the tomb and it was very strikingly different in architecture from the living quarter. The living quarters heeded to the emperor&amp;rsquo;s requirements in life and the tomb represented his journey in death. There is the courtyard with waiting stone mandarins and royal rides (horses and elephants) made of stone. These were arranged in two neat rows on either side. The courtyard led to a huge stone tablet up ahead that was inscribed with some script. The tablet and it&amp;rsquo;s shelter were flanked by two obelisks, one on either side. Further ahead was a walled enclosure with a gate. This enclosure contained the actual tomb in it&amp;rsquo;s center and felt something like a fairly simple maze. It was grand and quite morbid, as is to be expected of tombs. There were very few people around so it made for good photographs as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Tự Đức&#39;s tomb&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met a guy from Cyprus (first Cypriot I have met) in the complex. He was on a vacation with his mother who he had managed to lose somehow. 😂 He was in his middle ages and had been to India and had loved it! I think this is undoubtedly the best part about being an Indian traveller. You meet a lot of people have been to India and more often than not, they remember it fondly. This makes them smile in reminiscence and treat you with a warm bias when they talk to you. It is funny how you get to know more about your country and culture when you leave it. I walked around the other parts of the complex after Tự Đức&amp;rsquo;s tomb. There were some lesser known tombs of the other royal family members up ahead; some under renovation, some left to their abject state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8584/28833453941_16e8197ac3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tu-duc-prince-tomb-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Po&#39;ing around&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really liked this place, though the 100k still seemed too much. I walked around the extensive complex and ended up in the building next to the lake. I sat down to rest and enjoy the view. A tourist group came in after a while and the musicians, who had been resting, began to play. However, I was preparing to leave just then so I could appreciate the music very briefly. The instruments were interesting; strings, flutes and everyday things like cups and sticks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/140507143@N02/28804013852/in/album-72157671174977510/&#34; title=&#34;tu-duc-complex-musicians-video&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8703/28804013852_f9b2b9c25e.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tu-duc-complex-musicians-video&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;VIDEO : Royal Musicians&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was planning to do some more tombs and I asked Google Maps for the route to the one closest to where I was. It took me through a pine plantation and village roads! I really prefer such small unused roads to the big highways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8788/28877658186_e7bea134ee.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;road-pine-forestation&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Pine plantation&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached the &lt;strong&gt;Tomb of Thiệu Trị&lt;/strong&gt; in a short while. It seemed like an off-route place with very few tourists and I was half expecting there to be no ticket for this one. But there turned out to be one, and it was a 40 kVND worth. 😣 Huế had really costly tickets. I had found the entry fee in Hanoi pretty reasonable for single monuments and structures but Huế was too expensive. This complex did not seem to be much cared for as well. It lay in ruins which was it&amp;rsquo;s primary difference from Tự Đức&amp;rsquo;s tomb. The actual tomb was much the same in layout, though much less grand and much more in shambles. But there were beautiful lotus lakes in front of and behind the tomb to make up for the lost architectural beauty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8715/28293549563_cc99598fb3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;thieu-tri-tomb-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;A tomb in ruins&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Waiting mandarins&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to Tự Đức&amp;rsquo;s there was a living quarter/temple here as well but it was much too bare. I felt like I was walking through someone&amp;rsquo;s home while they were out on a vacation (not that I have ever done such a thing!). There courtyard and backyard here were probably prettier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Thiệu Trị&#39;s temple&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cat came out of somewhere to eye me suspiciously walking about the complex. I fancied it to be the ghost of one of the owners keeping an eye on my movements. There was a jackfruit tree with fruits hanging ripe and ready for the picking. It felt way too private for a tourist attraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8266/28877650986_a5e5610f49.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;thieu-tri-temple-cat&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Spooky cat don&#39;t like me&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked out of the complex and sat down on a bench to get my money&amp;rsquo;s worth. A dog waited for me to settle down before deciding to take a nap itself. I was not going for more tombs. I was financially done for the day. I left this complex around 5 PM and saw no one at the ticket counter. I might as well have come in at this time. 😐&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rode the bicycle back to the city, running into a small traffic jam right before entering it. I returned the bike at the hostel and took a bath before going back to Mandarin Cafe for some comfort food. Baked potatoes and chocolate shake. I sat in a cafe near the hostel and finished the &lt;a href=&#34;http://grasskode.xyz/post/readings/john-hick-philosophy-of-religion/&#34;&gt;Philosophy of Religion&lt;/a&gt; book that had finally got interesting towards the end. I also learnt the difference between a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ca Phe Sua Da&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bac Xiu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. I went back to the hostel to work a bit after asking if the cafe would be open for the match later in the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I returned to the cafe and sat watching the Austria vs Portugal match. A guy from Manchester, Daniel, joined me and we talked about football and travelling. He had travelled India extensively and used to be a bar manager back home. Interesting guy. He had taken up a job teaching English in HCMC and was travelling in Vietnam with a friend before joining the school next month. He told me about a football match that was going to take place in Da Nang the coming weekend and we exchanged contacts so that he could get in touch if the plan materialized. Him being a ManU fan, we discussed the Ronaldo-Messi rivalry. Daniel left after the first half and I sat doing the insta and watched the rest of the match because it was going in the funny freak football way that was to be typical of this Euro Cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;leaving-town&#34;&gt;Leaving Town&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up early for the Chile vs Colombia match that was delayed because of a storm. Chile won and progressed to the Copa finals. I booked a ticket to Hội An from the hostel. It was some bus service that I had not heard about but I decided not to be paranoid and give it a shot. I had time so I worked a bit and went to a nearby &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g293926-d1724500-Reviews-Nina_s_Cafe-Hue_Thua_Thien_Hue_Province.html&#34;&gt;cafe&lt;/a&gt; that was a tripadvisor success. The food was nice but a bit expensive, although I guess everything would be expensive when compared to the streetside places that I usually haunt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8653/28877649796_ba8aae6c9e.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ninas-cafe-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Nina&#39;s Cafe&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it was time, I went downstairs and a minivan came to pick me up. I was dropped at the main office of the bus service where the bus stood waiting. This was a &amp;ldquo;sleeper&amp;rdquo; bus; two levels of reclining seats arranged in three rows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8645/28840461031_98f8494957.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;sleeper-bus&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Sleeper tourist bus&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is how most of the tourist buses in Vietnam are. I felt a bit uncomfortable and stuck in those seats which were not my size. I was sleepy though and managed to drift off to sleep despite the cramped seats, cold AC and loud Vietnamese comedy show that was playing in the bus. I woke up a couple of times to see beautiful sceneries drift past my window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Through the window&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really liked Da Nang from what I saw while we crossed it. I had also gotten great reviews of the place from a few people during my travels. I was seriously considering coming to the city for a few days after Hội An but my month in Vietnam was seeming too short now.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>

&lt;p&gt;It seems like I had been planning a solo backpacking trip overseas for ages. In late May 2016, I finally took off for a trip through South East Asia like I had always wanted to. I was dismissive of all deterring arguments. I cared not what was happening to me or around me. This trip was all that mattered right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to Dong Hoi on the recommendation of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14123807.Aniket_Ketkar&#34;&gt;Aniket&lt;/a&gt;, a really awesome guy whom I have not met yet but we share a few common friends. Dong Hoi was the closest beach-side town to Phong Nha National Park, a UNESCO World heritage site and home to some of the most impressive caves! I was more than glad to have taken Aniket&amp;rsquo;s advice and put this amazing place on my itinerary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;beachside-and-phong-nha&#34;&gt;Beachside and Phong Nha&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I opened my phone to see Nils&amp;rsquo; reply to my message. He had reached Dong Hoi at 4 in the morning! He had taken a bus to transport his bike and was now waiting for me at the railway station. I got off the train at Dong Hoi and met him in the station building. We fetched his bike and pushed it to a nearby fuel station for a refill. Then we rode to a hostel that Aniket had recommended so highly that Dong Hoi came on my Vietnam itinerary despite not having had made the first draft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g659924-d8527355-Reviews-Beachside_Backpackers-Dong_Hoi_Quang_Binh_Province.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beachside Backpackers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;! The hostel, as the name suggests, is right on the beach, a little distance from the town. I went in and spotted Michaella and went over to say a hi. Aniket had introduced us online and she recognised me immediately. I met An next and he welcomed me as well. These people really love Aniket! I heard so much about him in the few days I was here that it feels a little weird to know so much about a person you have never met. An and Michaella run Beachside in the warmest of ways and we were immediately made to feel at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sat around in the cafe for a bit and had our breakfast before checking into a room in the cafe. No one rushes you at Beachside; not for for anything. There is no rush to get a room, none to order food, none to pay your bills. It is a lesson in the art of chilling! There were a few people around; two girls who had come in by the train that morning, an Australian expat (let&amp;rsquo;s call him Mr. A since he will be featuring consistently in this post) with his half Vietnamese daughter. We hung about, eating, drinking and playing pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8211/28462589850_68df185626.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;beachside-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Parenting done right&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nils and I were thinking of doing something rather than spend the entire day lazing around. So we asked An for suggestions and he told us to go see the &lt;strong&gt;Phong Nha&lt;/strong&gt; cave. Mr. A gave us the details about how to get the bus, what it would cost, how to get tickets, etc. Armed with all the information, we stood on the road and waited about 10 minutes for the bus to come along. We hopped in and it took us through some beautiful countryside and to Phong Nha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything at Phong Nha was as Mr. A had told us it would be. We got to the ticket counter and were asked to arrange more people if we wanted to share a boat. There is a fixed price for a boat which can carry up to 12 people. It costs dearly to rent out a boat between two people but the price is much more reasonable when it is shared. But how does one arrange more people when there are no other tourists around? While we were looking around, a minibus stopped and a family of 9 Vietnamese got out. Their guide was going to the counter and Nils asked him if he would like to share the boat with us. He nodded. Great! The deal was that we did not pay for the boat but gave a generous tip of 100 kVND to the boatwomen. Good deal in all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8217/28131587263_25a20c92d7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;phong-nha-boat-ride-9&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Boat ride to Phong Nha Cave&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got talking to the Vietnamese family while the motorboat made the long way from the boarding point to the cave. The man and his wife were based in Arizona, America and they were visiting Vietnam with their kids. They were taking their family on a Saigon to Hanoi trip. Many things struck me oddly similar to the story of Indians who had moved abroad to seek a better future. We reached the cave and right from the entrance it struck me as grand. It was big and the river ran into it. The motors were turned off once we got to the mouth of the cave and the tour inside was done using rows. This was my first time seeing a cave like this. I had read about the &lt;strong&gt;stalagmites and stalactites&lt;/strong&gt; as a kid but had never seen something this big and beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7712/28715129236_d014a85f71.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;phong-nha-cave-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Stalagmites and Stalactites&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was blown away! These formations were so pretty and psychedelic. I imagined seeing mushrooms and trees on rocks, Buddha heads, migrating pilgrims, ET and many more sci-fi stuff! The guide was explaining a few things in Vietnamese and the American couple translated the more interesting bits for us. But frankly, I was content just looking at the wonderful formations and marvelling at nature. There were quite a few people here but the cave was so big that it did not feel crowded. I took a lot of pictures but soon figured out that pictures barely did any justice to the place. It was an actual three dimensional experience that needed to be felt in it&amp;rsquo;s entirety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many more pictures of the Phong Nha Cave in the album at the end of the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We came back after a round of the cave and thanked the Vietnamese family at the docking point and gave the tip that we had agreed upon. Then we sat down for some food and while we were paying the bill, the bus to Dong Hoi rolled past us. The next one was an hour later so we sat in the same cafe for a bit longer and had some more sugarcane juice and coffee. Nils learnt some Vietnamese from the girl who worked at the cafe. Then we were joined by the bus driver and conductor of the next bus to Dong Hoi and they asked us the English for breasts. 😂 Men will be men, eh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at the hostel we went for a dip in the sea. The water was really cool and nice but there was a thunderstorm approaching. We got out, took showers and joined the barbecue party that the hostel had arranged for the night. It was a fun event with all you can eat barbecue buffet. All the hostel dwellers were there and many expats who were friends of An and Michaella. Mr. A was owning the conversation at my end of the table. We finished the food and sat around chatting about random things. It started drizzling and we finally went to the cafe when it picked up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nils, Mike (an American) and I sat playing cards. The girls from morning joined us : Paula, a Puerto Rican, and Whitney, an American. Mike left after a couple of games of rummy and then I taught the other guys &lt;em&gt;temperature&lt;/em&gt;. They caught up fast! Paula was extremely competitive and we played a few rounds before we decided to end the game. Nils, Whitney and I talked amongst each other and Paula went to talk to the Scots. Whitney was doing her PhD in Psychology. There was a lot of culture exchange about the three countries which is something I like much more than the superficial talks that the travellers routinely have. It is hilarious what ideas people hold or are told about another country that they have not personally experienced. For example, I had always thought that Americans were dumb and insufferable. Melody (from Bangkok) and Whitney helped me realise how wrong I have been to generalise the country&amp;rsquo;s people. A first generation American Indian friend of Whitney&amp;rsquo;s had told her a few things about India that I found ridiculous. One, that Patel was the most famous group of people in India (that guy was a Patel). And second, that Indians did not have pets because it was considered wrong to own a living being in India. I could not help but laugh at the second one. 😂 I told Whitney that India is a patriarchy; we definitely own other living beings there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-day-of-adventures&#34;&gt;A Day of Adventures&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;break-down&#34;&gt;Break Down&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up and found Nils sitting with his friends (from Ning Binh) in the cafe. They had come earlier in the morning. Nils and I had plans to go to the Dark Cave and Paradise Cave today. He had graciously agreed to take me as a pillion. But it was only when we were out on the highway that he told me he was new to riding! Fortunately he was a good rider and I did not suffer the anxiety that I usually do while riding pillion with stupid riders. Other than a situation where a cow threatened to cause trouble for us, the ride till Phong Nha went pretty smooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had stopped at Phong Nha to get some bandages for Nils, but as soon as we started again, the fuel pump of his bike broke down and started leaking petrol all over the engine! I quickly cut off the fuel supply and then we went about looking for a mechanic. We found one close by who made a fortune off Nils by selling him a new pump and replacing the accelerator cable that he broke himself. I quarrelled a bit about the accelerator cable but the guy was quite dismissive of his fault. The fact that we did not understand each other&amp;rsquo;s language was not helping my cause and he worked himself into a fury. I conceded and Nils and I justified it by admitting that the cable would have broke soon anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hit the road again as quickly as we could but it was already mid day by then. We had decided to cancel Paradise Cave so it was just Dark Cave now. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t too far from Phong Nha and we got there in no time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;dark-cave&#34;&gt;Dark Cave&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We put the bike in the parking and got the tickets. This one cost us a whooping 450 kVND but that included a bunch of adventure activities as well. We quickly harnessed up and strapped on a life-jacket. Then we moved with a bunch of people to the zip-lining tower. There was an Israeli couple in front of us and Nils and the girls started a conversation. She was a hippie who lived in New York and seemed extremely zoned out. Maybe as a result of too many chemicals. Whitney and Paula also came along and we exchanged hi&amp;rsquo;s. They had taken a tour of the Paradise and Dark Cave that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8406/28669533571_3363c83bd7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;dark-cave-zipline-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Zip-line tower&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was eventually my turn and I zip-lined across the river to the landing pad on the other side. It was nothing too exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/140507143@N02/28641725842/in/album-72157670874039440/&#34; title=&#34;dark-cave-zipline-video&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/8/7667/28641725842_46e4b14b12.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;dark-cave-zipline-video&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;VIDEO : Zip-lining&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were then supposed to wait for the rest of the people so I used the time jumping off a tree into the river. The leader of the group was an Irishman by the name of Jack. Nils, I and another guy completed the troupe. We did backflips and cannonballs in the river. I got winded on my first backflip and I am still not sure what caused it. Maybe it was the sudden temperature change; the water was somewhat cold!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My camera had lost battery after the zip-lining video and I was just foolishly carrying it around now. But I did test it in multiple circumstances and it is a tough one indeed! It took a couple of pictures of the Israeli couple who wanted me to mail it to them but never gave me their contact. So in case someone knows who they are, let them know! I just got a couple of pictures before the camera completely lost all battery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8690/28129453584_f78704b97f.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;dark-cave-israeli-couple&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;The Israeli couple. If someone knows them, point them to this pic! 😝&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8819/28669536631_1a1245ce66.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;dark-cave-entrance-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Dark Cave&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once everyone had gathered around, we swam to the entrance of the cave which was just 20 meters off. Then we turned on the lights of the helmet and went inside the Dark Cave. There were no electric lighting here which lent it it&amp;rsquo;s name. This one was not as spectacular as the other caves but it was nice and huge and dark. We walked around in a line and entered a tunnel which kept getting narrower and muddier till we ended up in a pool of mud! This was the mud bath. We fooled around for a bit, splashing each other with mud and discovering that muddy water makes you extremely buoyant. It was difficult keeping your balance and you helplessly splashed about if you lost your footing! The bigger the group of friends that you come with, the more fun would it be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phong Nha Tip #1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go do Dark Cave with a big bunch of friends! It is much more fun that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got out of the mud bath and washed up before getting back into our life jackets (which we had dumped near the entrance of the tunnel). Then we were supposed to kayak to the other side of the river. Nils went ahead because I had stalled and found myself at the end of the line. I recognised one of the girls by her singsong English accent. We had met before in Ninh Binh and it so happened that she, her friend and I were the last three left to grab a kayak. All three of us were hopeless at it though. We paddled around pointlessly, turning into the wrong direction and making it to the other side in the most beelined fashion as was possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were some water activities on this side. A short &amp;ldquo;zip-line and jump into the water&amp;rdquo; thing and an obstacle course like thing made over the river. I tried them both. The obstacle course was tough and the river flowing underneath gave you the feeling of moving. I enjoyed all of it though. It was completely worth the money and the time spent. 👍&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-lost-the-keys&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;I Lost the Keys&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got out and dried ourselves before changing and getting the bike. We thought of going to a water spring that was supposedly just 2 kilometers away. I was not navigating on the map and we ended up missing it. We stopped on some hilly roads inside the Phong Nha National Park and get some photographs. These roads reminded me of Himachal for some reason. The mountains were much more rocky and covered with a consistent green foliage. It was really beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Nils the photographer!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ran into a truck on the narrow road and were unable to overtake it. So we stopped in a field at the side of the road to put some distance between us and the truck and to get some more pictures. We could see a structure up ahead but it was not clear what it was. Nils thought it was a house and I thought it was a big pile of straw. So we decided to go investigate. We got distracted by some buffaloes and a man walking in the field and started taking their photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, Nils realised that he had lost the bike&amp;rsquo;s keys! It was in his hand when he took out his camera and was mysteriously gone while he was clicking photographs. We spent the next thirty to forty minutes walking up and down the small area where the key could have been dropped. We parted shrubs and upturned garbage. Nils also checked his bag multiple times. It is really a wonder where the key went! Unable to find the key after multiple tries, we decided to push the bike till Phong Nha, which was another 40 minutes walk away, and try our luck there. It would be dark soon and there was no reason to hope that we&amp;rsquo;d find the keys now if we had not found it yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we pushed the bike, a few tourists who were with us at Dark Cave stopped on their bikes. One of them had a Win and we tried her key hoping it&amp;rsquo;d would work but it did not. They left with puzzled faces as to how we could have lost the key. We just smiled foolishly and waved them goodbye. I realised later that we could have done a bike tow! There were a few locals who offered us petrol thinking that might be the reason we were pushing the bike. Finally, a little before the Phong Nha town, a young man stopped and asked us what the matter was. He spoke good English and laughed when we told him that we had lost the key. He produced a pair of scissors and tried turning on the ignition using them. It worked! He was our hero for the day. We thanked the boy and jumped on the bike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a small break to grab some beer and noodle soup, Nils offered me to ride the rest of the way back to Dong Hoi. Of course I gladly accepted! It got dark on the way and the headlights came on. Ours was barely useful because it pointed left from the center. I slowed down and we got back to the hostel at a safe and easy pace. I washed up and watched the Italy vs Sweden match. It was a dull anticlimax to end the extremely exciting day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get a good bike if you are planning to do the Vietnam road trip. Most of the Win&amp;rsquo;s are uncomfortable pieces of shit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-expat-community&#34;&gt;The Expat Community&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was planning to take the day off and do nothing for a change. I had some breakfast and lay down on one of the hammocks to read a book. The book managed to make me drowsy and I fell asleep on the hammock. When I woke up, Michaella told me that Kevin and Beth had come around to see me and had been waiting for a while! These were friends of Aniket who had been living in Dong Hoi for about a year. Aniket had put me in touch with them and they had come around to see if I was around. Our introductions got weird at the part when they asked me how I knew Aniket. I had to explain how I was a &amp;ldquo;friend&amp;rdquo; of Aniket who had never met him!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note to self : meet &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14123807.Aniket_Ketkar&#34;&gt;Aniket&lt;/a&gt; some day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the next hour or so talking to them. They are amazing people taking a break from their corporate lives in America to volunteer in Vietnam. They teach children how to swim and Beth also takes yoga classes for people with disabilities and helps institutes to develop skills for resume building and preparing for interviews. They had left their established careers for this and it was quite an inspiring story. They had gotten married last August and they told me the beautiful story of the proposals. It was a nice hour long conversation which ended because they had plans to meet some friends. I was invited to join them for a party later that evening and Kevin also gave me some recommendations of restaurants in town that I intended to check out. Once they left, I returned to my hammock and fell asleep again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day quickly went by. All the inactivity was not exactly what I had imagined it to be and I was somewhat bored towards the evening. Whitney and Paula had left and Nils was missing (getting his bike fixed most probably). I wrote, drank beers and lay around in the hammock. Having had enough, I decided to go to town and started walking out of the hostel. An stopped me and offered me one of the free bicycles and I took him up on his offer. I rode to the city heading for one of the food joints Kevin had suggested. The town was all lit up, as if for Diwali. And it all seemed like a regular affair rather than preparation for an occasion. The bridge had an amusing moving light pattern. The beach area near the town was full of people. There were public parks and seafood joints. Dong Hoi was celebrating it&amp;rsquo;s evening in style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7713/28746955825_7572e1d804.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;dong-hoi-city-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Lit up Dong Hoi&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The place was a small establishment called &lt;strong&gt;Tu Quy&lt;/strong&gt;. It was quite busy and I sat down to share the table with a Vietnamese guy. He spoke a fair amount of English so we could get to know each other a bit. He lived in Hanoi and was in Dong Hoi for some work. I ordered some rice vermicelli and pork only to realise later, when the guy pointed out, that it was similar to &lt;em&gt;Bun Cha&lt;/em&gt;. This was &lt;em&gt;Bun Thit Nuong&lt;/em&gt;, a dish that was to become another of my favourites in Vietnam. My fellow diner had ordered the rice wrap which was similar to &lt;em&gt;Banh Xeo&lt;/em&gt; I had had in Ninh Binh. He offered me a neatly rolled wrap to taste. Even the shop owner let off 5 kVND from my bill because he did not have the exact change. How can you not love such people?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8787/28669546751_b28a9ceaf5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tu-quy&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Kevin eyes my first Bun Thit Nuong in Vietnam&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rode further into town instead of returning to Beachside immediately. I ran into a public square of sorts with a pretty fountain and something that looked like a historical structure. A coffee shop nearby was airing the football match on a projector and I ended up sitting for it and drinking a couple of coffees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I rode back to the hostel. With a kilometer to go, I realised that the rear tyre had gone flat and walked the rest of the way. Kevin had messaged me about the party that night. It was the opening party of a new hostel that was three doors down from Beachside. The new place, &lt;em&gt;Tiki&lt;/em&gt;, was weirdly similar to Beachside but still quite well done. People were quite drunk by the time I reached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat between James, Kevin&amp;rsquo;s friend and Daniel, a Dutch expat and enjoyed their short debate about American culture. Daniel said that America did not have a culture and James, an Asian American, said it did. Daniel said it was simply a melting pot. Daniel thought that even that was a culture of it&amp;rsquo;s own. It took me a while to adjust because of the difference in the level of alcohol in our bodies. 😜 I eventually started participating in the conversations but by then people had started leaving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually it was just Daniel, Yeras (a Czech expat) and me who were sitting drinking beer and talking about random things. Daniel was 28, was working as an English teacher, had taken a Vietnamese wife and was father to two sons with a third on the way. He was happy and successful in Vietnam, much more than he had been at home and said that many that he knew were leaving Netherlands for places abroad to seek similar happiness. Life in Netherlands was tougher for them than it was out here. Yeras was 32 and was an English teacher himself. His problem was that he did not find the work challenging enough. The talks then took a more philosophical turn when Yeras asked the question : why cannot humans work together instead of fighting each other. It would take another dedicated post to expound on that idea but to put it in short, the night was extremely interesting. We drained the last keg of beer for all it was worth and left for our beds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;paradise&#34;&gt;Paradise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up early to catch the Copa semi final matches. Argentina trampled USA and Chile destroyed Mexico. The Copa matches were way better than the Euro ones in terms of the quality of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8686/28131640573_b8acf127d1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;cafe-sua-da&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Coffee and football make for a happy morning&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nils and I went back to Tu Quy for some breakfast. We had the rice wraps and I told him about the philosophical debates of the night before. We indulged in some early morning philosophising ourselves. Then we went to the local market to buy miscellaneous fruits that were taken back to the hostel to be blended into smoothies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nils was arranging for a visa run to extend his stay in Vietnam so I rented out a clutch-less bike from An and went back to Phong Nha. The bike was in a much better condition than the one I had ridden in Mandalay and my opinion of clutch-less bikes changed considerably by the end of the day. I took the HCM Road out of Dong Hoi and stuck to a speed of 60-70 kmph throughout. The sun was not harsh and this made the ride all the more enjoyable. I used my otherwise unemployed left hand to click some photos from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many more pictures of the HCM highway in the album at the end of the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rode past Phong Nha and on the road that we had taken back a couple of days ago after losing the keys. The road seemed longer today, probably because of my anxiety regarding the petrol. The indicator seemed to be dipping quickly and there would be no petrol pump to be found inside the national park area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Beautiful green hills&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took the deviation for &lt;strong&gt;Paradise Cave&lt;/strong&gt; and parked my bike in the provided space. The attendant-cum-guard gave me an old ticket and when I complained that the ticket was a used one, as usual, he did not comprehend. I pointed at the number on the ticket so he just crossed it out and wrote the one from my bike. I shook my head and walked on. It was not worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched some commotion as I bought a bottle of water from one of the shops outside the complex. Some animal was being scared away and from the distance that everyone was keeping from where the creature was hiding, it was probably a dangerous one. I suspected snake but the thing ran away before I had a chance to see it. My questions to the locals were dismissed with a wave of the hand. I walked to the ticket counter and bought an entrance ticket for 250 kVND. Another 100k would have gotten me a buggy ride. I was not really going to pay that much for a pointless luxury. A 15 minute walk on a pretty and well-shaded trail brought me to where the buggy was dropping all the tourists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8368/28641767992_69d0efef14.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;paradise-3&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Buggy stop&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone anyway had to do the climb that followed. I was faster than most of the people and it took me a mere 15 minutes to do this as well. The humid weather was unbearable and I was hot and dripping by the time I reached the entrance of the cave. The air coming out of the cave was heavy, cool and damp; a welcome respite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paradise was &lt;strong&gt;HUGE&lt;/strong&gt;! I already knew what to expect from caves in terms of stalactites and stalagmites from the trip in the Phong Nha cave. Paradise had simply scaled everything up rather impressively. Plus one could walk in closer proximity to examine these works of natural art. There were huge pillars and extremely intricate and beautiful designs. Too bad that everyone had to stick to a defined path but that was the sanest thing to do. The grandness of the cave can only be experienced. It felt like some alien lair out of a sci-fi movie!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8305/28462632570_18c8238f6a.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;paradise-cave-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;The Alien Lair&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked till the end of the walkway and then rushed back to get away from a group with a Vietnamese guy smoking inside the cave despite all the signs that said otherwise. There are morons everywhere I guess. The closed cave made the smoke much thicker and the smell lingered on. I took a lot of pictures. There were all the usual unearthly designs and trees on rocks structures. There was a hut, a rabbit, a dragon and what not!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Rock formations at Paradise Cave&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was walking back, I noticed a white light that showed some white particles suspended in the air. This explained the heaviness of the air! I wondered if it affected asthmatic people. Anyhow, I spent a few minutes blowing it around and observing the beautiful diffraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went on a clicking frenzy in Paradise. Though the pictures do not really convey the beauty of the cave, there are more of them in the album at the end of the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked back up the stairs and out of the cave. I quickly hopped the steps back to the ground level and passed the people waiting for buggies. 15 minutes later I was at the parking putting my helmet on and watching a bunch of young foreigners teaching one of themselves ride a bike. I rode back the same route I had taken to get in. My mind was preoccupied with the depleting level of petrol. I quickly reached the HCM highway and immediately found a petrol pump. Sweet! I overfilled this time. My paranoia of cheating petrol pump staff caused the attendant here some pain as I troubled him about getting a proper look at the meter reading. But then, better safe than sorry. 😛 I rode back and crossed the turn for Phong Nha city. There were rice fields and river which I had not appreciated on the few times I had crossed the stretch before and I stopped to take pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Rice fields&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had noticed a sign that said &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pub with Cold Beer - 2 km&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; the first time I had crossed it when I was riding pillion with Nils two days ago. It had been on my mind and I turned around when I crossed the sign again. I checked the time and decided I had enough to quickly check the place out. It was still a little while to sundown and I really wanted to see this interesting sounding place. I took the turn into the narrow lane and the road turned into a dirt track after a hundred meters or so. I enjoyed the 2 kilometer long stretch that was well marked with boards leading to the pub.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Off-roading to The Pub with Cold Beer&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took my bike into a modest looking complex but there was no one around and I was wondering if the place was open. I hello&amp;rsquo;ed a couple of times and a woman finally came out of the house and nodded to my question of whether the place was open. Then she pulled out a beer from the fridge and asked me to take a seat. The beer was &lt;strong&gt;cold&lt;/strong&gt; as promised! I also ordered a plate of rice and pork which came with some delicious peanut based gravy. I had no idea why this place was not on the radar and I did my bit by adding a &lt;a href=&#34;https://goo.gl/maps/MEdq5LabtcG2&#34;&gt;listing&lt;/a&gt; on Google Maps.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Kevin likes a cold beer after a long day!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I sat eating, two more scooters came in. The guys were Brent (Canadian) and Luke (from London). They had done Dark cave today and we talked for a bit. My skill of striking and keeping up random conversations was definitely improving. I needed to leave quickly though because I had to make my way back to Dong Hoi and I am not a big fan of driving after the headlights come on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phong Nha Tip #2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you go to &amp;ldquo;The Pub with Cold Beer&amp;rdquo; and make sure that you go there to spend a lazy day in the hammocks doing nothing but eating delicious food, drinking cold beer and playing a few games of pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made my way back to the HCM highway and turned in the direction of Dong Hoi. I took some pictures as the sun set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at Dong Hoi I hunted for a non existent DongA ATM because wikivoyage said it did not charge for withdrawals. I eventually ended up using another ATM that charged more than most of the others. I came back to the hostel and did some laundry. I had to skip the barbecue party because I was somewhat full with the food and beer I had had earlier in the evening. Then I sat and played mau-mau with Nils; it is basically UNO with cards. I also discovered that dragon fruit smoothies taste awful. Then Nils and I played a couple of games of chess on a rusted board before calling it a night. It was goodbye because Nils would leave for Laos early in the morning for his visa run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A South African guy walked up to me and was quick to identify me as an Indian. Apparently South Africa has the largest Indian community outside India. I did not know that. He had been teaching English in Cambodia and South Vietnam for a while. He had a few interesting stories to tell. There were two English girls who had come in late in the night as well. Mike, the American guy, was also there. We talked about a few things and the Vietnam war came up. He told me about a couple of people in Da Nang who had lived through the period and were willing to talk about their experiences if you visited their cafe. I was also quite surprised at how people like Mike who so very well understand that their government is screwing up affairs worldwide can just put the blame on the government. Democracy is what their country sells, is it not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;saying-goodbye&#34;&gt;Saying Goodbye&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just sat in Beachside all day long. Those guys pamper you to no end. When I told An that I was going to the town a little early to book my ticket, he took my passport on the pretext of making telephonic reservation and went out to book the ticket himself! When I told him he shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have, he just shrugged his shoulders and smiled. 😊 So all I had to do was eat and read my book till it was time for the train.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Delicious food was all I needed to take care of!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mau, one of the staff, dropped me to the station on his bike. His home was right next to &amp;ldquo;The Pub with Cold Beer&amp;rdquo; and I told him I had gone there the previous day. He had been working at Beachside for 6 months now and had decent English. He was not much of a student in school but had fared pretty well since. I had to literally force the tip on him after he dropped me. Everyone in Beachside had been so nice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat down to wait in the station. When I got up to check the display for the train timings, a nice girl offered to help me out. She translated an announcement of delay for me and then helped me find the coach and the seat in the train. This was Bibi and she was travelling with her friend, Miss Han. Bibi&amp;rsquo;s English was good but Miss Han&amp;rsquo;s wasn&amp;rsquo;t all that great. However, it was Miss Han who was more willing to talk. She was a woman in her mid or late thirties and a &lt;em&gt;yogini&lt;/em&gt;. She also had a friend from Hyderabad. She showed me his video from a dance show he had done in Vietnam and then took a selfie with me! Later in the train, she offered me a mango as well and greeted me with a &lt;em&gt;namaste&lt;/em&gt;! 😅&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The train was running a little late. The more railways I travel, the more I am in awe of &lt;em&gt;Indian Railways&lt;/em&gt;. Vietnam had just a single line in parts despite this being their main line. The route was not electrified and this was something I had seen in Thailand as well. The tickets are quite expensive and I am sure not if all can afford it. There is the air conditioning to justify the cost, but that makes it all the more a luxury rather than an affordable mode of travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a nap in the train. Bibi and Miss Han were getting off at Hue as well and Bibi came to remind me of the stop when our destination was due. I got off and followed them to the exit and thanked them profusely for all their help. They were taking a cab and would have surely offered to drop me had I not refused all further help. I was feeling a bit overwhelmed as it was.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>

&lt;p&gt;It seems like I had been planning a solo backpacking trip overseas for ages. In late May 2016, I finally took off for a trip through South East Asia like I had always wanted to. I was dismissive of all deterring arguments. I cared not what was happening to me or around me. This trip was all that mattered right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left Hanoi for Ninh Binh, a small town two hours south of the capital, best known for it&amp;rsquo;s remarkable limestone &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karst&#34;&gt;karst&lt;/a&gt; landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ninh-binh&#34;&gt;Ninh Binh&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bus dropped me 2 kilometers before the bus stop. They probably thought I wanted to go to Tam Coc, where most of the backpackers head. I was flustered but I had not yet mastered the art of conveying what I wanted to say in the lack of a common language. I would learn that later but for now, I was pushed out by the conductor with a reassuring smile that this was where I wanted to get off while I kept pointing straight ahead. Google Maps was not quick enough to load and I found myself looking at the back of the bus as I figured out I would have to walk for the next twenty minutes to get to the hostel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t so bad despite the sultry heat and the hostel turned out to be a really nice one. I knew that it was the renovated old station building and that explained why it was so generously spacious and airy. The dorm room was alright with all the required facilities. Good choice! I saw a rare member of the pedigree Indian traveller while I was checking in. As is customary, we refused to acknowledge each other&amp;rsquo;s existence and he was checking out of the hostel anyway so there was no need to fear a further interaction. Amusingly, we were introduced by a common friend on Facebook that very night! Sometimes you have to hand it over to the universe; it has an amazing sense of humour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7561/28349702692_b040caae4b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ninh-binh-roads-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Eerie empty roads of Ninh Binh&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was too late in the day to do any sightseeing so I decided to wander around. It seemed to me that the city had grown without sufficient reason. There were empty and wide roads all around. It looked like a hollow city. I walked up to the new railway station. It was in the middle of barren lands and seemed grander than it should have been. I walked in to find out how I could book a ticket to my next destination. It seemed a simple enough procedure, although I could not book a ticket then and there because I did not have my passport on me. There was a tout who was offering to sell me a ticket but I did not quite understand why anyone would use a tout for something so simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8809/28422271816_90c3b0f504.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ninh-binh-station&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Ninh Binh Railway Station&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wandered through the lanes of the empty city. The kids here were amazingly friendly. You encounter a &lt;em&gt;hello&lt;/em&gt; almost every time you cross a kid on the streets. There are usually more &lt;em&gt;hellos&lt;/em&gt; and a few questions that follow if you choose to reply and engage in a conversation of limited vocabulary. Some kids run away after hurling the &lt;em&gt;hello&lt;/em&gt; at you, so you wonder at times where it came from.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Just Kids!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the adults usually stare at you with a look of curiosity mixed with amusement. Probably trying to figure out where you are from and what you are doing in the narrow residential lanes of their town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not able to find interesting people in the hostel, I went walking once again in the evening. I first ate some delicious &lt;em&gt;banh xeo&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;nem lui&lt;/em&gt;. You are given a tray full of ingredients and are supposed to roll them up into a tasty snack. I came back for it once again on my last day in town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8802/28422275886_70efdbd16b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;banh-xeo-nem-lui&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Banh xeo with nem lui - Wrap and roll!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then walked to the north-east of the town where a green patch on Google Maps seemed like an interesting destination to look up. And it was! It was a big park full of locals who were starting to pour in for their evening walks and jogs. The ill maintained park had a mini-zoo and swings as well. Seemed like the recreational hub of the town. There were some elderly women standing in a line and giving a back massage to the one in front. I found it extremely amusing but despite their candidness, could not muster the confidence to stand and point a camera at them. I had still not gotten used to taking photographs of strangers. I just shot a video while passing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;VIDEO : Back Massage!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a staircase going up a rock at the end of the park. There was a small view point up there, a bust of some famous person, a shelter with Chinese roofs, a Vietnamese flag and the hammer and sickle of Socialism. I wandered around for a bit, looking at the interesting sights and people that the small rock had to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Pretty resting spot&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I walked back towards the hostel, an old man started talking to me. He asked me where I was from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;India.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He did not get me. &lt;em&gt;Spanish?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No. An Do.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He still did not get me but offered me a beer which I refused because of my experiences with over-friendly locals in Hanoi. I debated on how wise I had acted while I walked back to the hostel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vietnam Tip #6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could learn the Vietnamese name of your country to tell them to the locals. They almost always ask for your country and hearing it in their own language makes them happier! India is &lt;em&gt;An Do&lt;/em&gt; in Vietnamese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hostel was airing the Euro Cup matches and my nights here would be spent in the common area watching these matches, at times with interesting and other times with forgettable people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;karst-landscapes&#34;&gt;Karst Landscapes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day I rented a bicycle from the hostel. It was rather expensive, even for a mountain bike. It cost me 70 kVND while a motorbike was 100 kVND. However, I wanted to do something physical as I had been feeling sloppy of late so I chose the former.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two places around Ninh Binh that boast of the limestone karst landscape : &lt;strong&gt;Tam Coc&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Trang An&lt;/strong&gt;. Of these, Tang An is the less touristy one and a &lt;a href=&#34;http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/&#34;&gt;UNESCO world heritage&lt;/a&gt; site as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;trang-an&#34;&gt;Trang An&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rode towards Trang An in the relentless sun. It burned me despite the dark tan I had already acquired. The limestone rocks presented themselves a little out of Ninh Binh. They looked amazing; a rock standing abruptly in the middle of a plain. I actually had no idea what to expect from Trang An as I had left that bit in my research as a (hopefully pleasant) surprise. I also kept looking for a place that served local specialty &lt;em&gt;De Nui&lt;/em&gt; (mountain goat) but ended up not having it anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8687/28422288236_c5c4510a6b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;trang-an-road-karst&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Limestone rocks&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip #10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always leave a certain gap in your research in order to enjoy the place that you are visiting. For historical places, you might want to read up a bit but don&amp;rsquo;t see a hundred pictures of the landscapes you are about to visit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Trang An, I parked the bike by paying 15 kVND. This felt rather stupid because bicycles should be free or negligible to park. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why but it just seems wrong to charge bicycles and motorbikes the same amount! I also bought the traditional conical hat in my typical style of taking precautions &lt;strong&gt;after&lt;/strong&gt; I had been burnt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entry ticket cost me 150 kVND. It seemed somewhat steep at first but was more than justified later. It included the price of the boat that was to take me around. A boat can easily take 4 people so I had to wait a little before being adjusted with a Vietnamese family that spread out across three boats. They seemed rather reluctant to have me initially but gave me a seat to sit in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8631/28349733662_ae5724f6b5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;trang-an-boatride-1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Boat trip with a Vietnamese family&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set out in the rowboat with the boatwoman rowing from behind and me and another guy helping out with single paddles from the front. Two ladies and a baby occupied the middle seat. Life jackets were provided but reluctantly enforced. The sun was harsh, the water was cool and the scenery was amazing. Our three boats stuck together as we rowed into the lake amongst the huge limestone rocks. Signs of civilization have been found in these rocks and there is an occasional structure looming here and there. We came upon a temple and the Vietnamese family talked to the boatwoman in their language. I had no idea what they exchanged but we ended up skipping the temple. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t complaining. I had seen enough of temples anyway. I was more interested in the natural sceneries of the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8694/28376055361_d76ac73887.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;trang-an-boatride-6&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Beautiful scenery at Trang An&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was expecting this to be the end of the trip and for us to turn around but we continued forward. I could not see a way ahead, just a big rock that we seemed to be heading straight at. Were we heading there for a swim? As we got closer, I could see a small gap under the rock, but it did not seem like a likely destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8137/28349741482_3868138c36.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;trang-an-boatride-9&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Heading into a rock&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got closer and the first boat did not slow down; it slipped right into the seemingly impossibly small gap! Our boat went in as well. These river tunnels were extremely exciting and amazing. The ceiling was mostly inches away from the head and at times you needed to duck to evade it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/140507143@N02/28454288005/in/album-72157671268456526/&#34; title=&#34;trang-an-tunnel&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8606/28454288005_d5c5158b34.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;281&#34; alt=&#34;trang-an-tunnel&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;VIDEO : Passing the tunnel&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of such tunnels but the first two were the best ones. They were the most natural while some of the others had been obviously cut up to aid the passage of boats. There was electric lighting to aid visibility as well. The boatwomen oared with practiced expertise. Almost all the boats were handled by women and this was quite a physically taxing task!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8269/28376061911_80f831e0f3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;trang-an-boatride-19&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Inside the river tunnels&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire experience got somewhat tedious after a while but that was probably because of the weather. The hot and humid climate made the stretches between the tunnels painful. The lack of a wind did not help either. We took breaks in the shade of the caves and skipped all the temples. The entire trip lasted two and a half hours and I just wonder how much longer would it have been had we stopped at the three temples on the way. The Vietnamese family had warmed up to my presence and offered me water and some snacks. I had come ill prepared because I was expecting the trip to be much shorter! There are shops set up in the temple complexes though, so one could stop there to pick up some nibbles and drinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boatwomen are extremely skilled. They can row the boat with their hands as well as their feet! They do it by themselves to rest their arms at times. But you can simply ask them for a demonstration and they might oblige.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many more pictures of the tunnels and Trang An in the album at the end of the post!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at the wharf I tipped our boatwoman an amount similar to what the family had given and sat to cool down. There were options for food and refreshment here but I was thinking of getting something from some place more local.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8621/28422304586_a0047bc1ec.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;trang-an-disturbing-statue&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Disturbing statues at the wharf&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I was rested, I went to get my bike. This was not entirely without complications. The parking attendant had changed and the new one was asking for money that I had already paid to the previous attendant. I tried explaining but she did not understand English. After much frustration, it was here that I realised the power of the &lt;strong&gt;Google Translate&lt;/strong&gt; app. I pulled out my phone, typed in what I wanted to say, translated it and handed it to her. She read it, smiled and let me out. It was really that simple!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip #11&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be frustrated at the lack of a common language. Technology makes things simple, use it. Many people can read their language despite not being able to understand your&amp;rsquo;s! Keep your phone charged and a translation app handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;bich-dong-pagoda&#34;&gt;Bich Dong Pagoda&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to go to Tam Coc next to check it out. I rode through the internal roads which were not as hot as the barren highways. The countryside was unspectacular for me though. It was a typical village and I have seen many of the kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tam Coc itself turned out to be very much a backpacker ghetto. I had initially thought of eating there but the burger joints and pizzerias made me change my mind. I pedalled on and reached the &lt;strong&gt;Bich Dong Pagoda&lt;/strong&gt; at the end of the Tam Coc road. There was a 10 kVND parking fee here as well! All this was ruffling me up. But the pagoda was nice enough to calm me down. There was no entrance fee for the pagoda itself, which, though expected, was a relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8710/28171823800_6c411ea2d3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bich-dong-entrance&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Entrance to Bich Dong Pagoda promised serenity&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked around the temple that I saw. A monk was cleaning the premises and we exchanged smiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8870/28349774052_72cb2c787f.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bich-dong-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Temple : Level 1&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just when I was thinking &amp;ldquo;Is this it?&amp;rdquo;, I saw a board pointing to a staircase. I went up to find another small temple. I just saw all these temples from the outside. I did not go into any of them, mostly because I was too tired to take off my shoes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8749/28171826450_69426b7640.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bich-dong-4&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Temple : Level 2&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a passage going behind it that I supposed went around the temple and I decided to take a round. The path was somewhat dark and I heard muffled steps coming from the other end before seeing a girl emerge out of the darkness. Upon getting closer, I saw that the path actually led to a staircase that went up into the dark. Alright. I climbed up to the sounds of bats. It was a friggin&amp;rsquo; cave! And it was &lt;strong&gt;dark&lt;/strong&gt;! A real bat cave! 😜&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg vertimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8036/28349776892_e2011791de.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bich-dong-5&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;From the Bat Cave!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used the camera for some light since my phone was dead. The other side of the cave was another small temple and a path going further up. I climbed to a yet smaller temple up there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8775/28422309226_c0c249751b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bich-dong-6&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Temple : Level 3&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8838/28171830600_78f227bcf3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bich-dong-7&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Temple : Level 4&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A girl was sitting on the steps and I asked her whether this was the end of the levels. There was a stony path ahead but there was also a sign that said &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do not Climb Up&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. She shrugged and replied that a few friends of hers had gone up. I could hear and see two fellows up there. So I climbed up as well. The view was nice and there was a slight breeze. Was this it? They said two more of their friends were further up! This was where I finally went from &amp;ldquo;Amazing!&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;WTF!&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could hear voices and they came into sight soon. They were climbing down and I asked them what it was like up there. They told me its beautiful but also told me to be careful of the rocks since they were really sharp. I put the hat back and the camera and glasses in the bag and readied myself for the climb. This was the first real test for my new shoes. The mud disappeared soon enough and I seemed to be walking on rocks of weird shapes. After a day of marvelling at them from a distance, I was finally seeing a karst up close. It seemed like there were spikes and spines made in the rock. I climbed a little further using my hands to pull me through. Then I sat for a breather and saw the exhilarating scenery from above. The vast krast landscape looked beautiful from this height.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8858/28454373535_914a6c7ef1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bich-dong-11&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Karst scenery&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I climbed a bit further but then stopped when I realised that there was no one around nor was likely to be. In case of a problem I would, quite literally, find myself between a rock and a hard place. So I backed up and came down. I rode back to the hostel sweaty and happy at all the physical activity that I had gotten throughout the day. I rewarded myself by going to the town&amp;rsquo;s Jollibee later that night to satisfy my craving for a burger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8777/27838095054_76f4032995.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;jollibee&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Burger!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat watching the matches in the common room that night and met two Germans there, Ricardo and Nils. Ricardo had been to India and had lived in Auroville for 3 months. I asked him how the place worked since it had always been a mystery to me. But it turned out to be the same old money minded thing. He was a proper traveller who was big on couchsurfing and all in all a pretty cool guy. Nils was biking from Hanoi to Saigon and had the scars from a recent bike accident. I showed the guys pictures and videos from Trang An, recommending the place and then once Ricardo had left, I showed Nils pictures from my Ladakh trip. I try selling India at every opportunity I get!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;vietnamese-railway&#34;&gt;Vietnamese Railway&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up early for the Copa match. The unimpressive breakfast at the hostel was also expensive. Nils came around and we started talking again. I had told him about my plans to do the caves near Dong Hoi and he was interested as well. I told him that I was planning to go by train and told him how he could book his tickets using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.baolau.vn/&#34;&gt;baolau&lt;/a&gt;. But he got busy with a girl who was hitting on him so I let them be. Young love! 😄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked out of the hostel and dumped my bag in their storage room. I told Nils that I would be around since my train left late in the night. He was planning on going to Tam Coc so we would not have a chance to sync up till much later in the day. I went back to the railway station to book my ticket. The hat really helped! Despite the sun, I was at relative ease when I reached the station. There was no one at the counter though. I sat for a good 15-20 minutes before I decided to go out and seek some &lt;em&gt;Bun Cha&lt;/em&gt; which I had started craving somewhat. But there was no &lt;em&gt;Bun Cha&lt;/em&gt; to be found. In fact, there was no decent food option around which is rather surprising for a railway station. When I returned to the station, I found a lady at the counter and booked my ticket for Dong Hoi despite the rickety communication. We used a pen and a paper to explain ourselves to one another. I got a hard seat in the sleeper class, an upper berth which I actually prefer, for 369 kVND. It was considerably less than the price I had seen on baolau.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Communication skills&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came back to the hostel and sat working. Made some improvements in the blog. I was getting a hang of the front-end technologies. Then I decided to go walking around the town once again. I went to the &lt;em&gt;Cho&lt;/em&gt; (local market) and finally found the people of Ninh Binh! So this was where they all lived. My hostel and the railway station were in the outskirts of the town. The market had vegetables, meat, fruits, flowers, clothes, shoes and more; all available in whole sale! I walked around and returned with the satisfaction of having had found the people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Cho Ninh Binh&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While walking back, I ran into an alley which had been converted into a badminton court. There were men in their 60&amp;rsquo;s or so playing and I stopped to watch. I found their athleticism quite remarkable for their age. But they started looking at me a little uneasily, so I decided to stop hanging around in the shadows and leave them to their game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ricardo came around as I sat writing in the common room. We talked about his day and then he asked me if I played Chinese Chess. I did not know that there was a Chinese version of the game! Unfortunately we could not find it in the hostel so we had to leave it be. He told me about it and it sounded interesting (I am now trying to learn the game using an app on my phone). We sat to watch the ongoing football match and talked some more. He would have been one cool person to stay in touch with but he did not have any online accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nils&amp;rsquo; friend came up to me to give me his contact. He had gone out but had asked me to get in touch. I left him a message and then picked up my bag and made for the station around 10:15 PM. My train was at 11 in the night. I was hoping to find Nils there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roads were awfully quiet. I realised that it was the lack of noisy drunk men and barking street dogs that lent the streets this haunted silence. The sky was clouded but there was no wind, as usual. A veiled moon added to the spookiness of the night. I got to the station and sat waiting with a number of other Vietnamese people. No Nils though. The gates opened 5 minutes before the train was due. The people flocked on to the platform and waited for the train to arrive. It did so shortly afterwards and I walked up to my coach where an official checked my ticket and I was admitted inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Boarding the train&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cabins were like the first class category of India and I found my seat number printed outside one of them. The upper berth of the three tiered sleepers in Vietnam almost touches the ceiling! There was very little room for maneuvering oneself. The freezing air-conditioner had a vent right above my head and I had trouble falling asleep. I did sleep eventually but it was intermittently broken with the fear of missing my station. I kept checking my phone every hour to see if it was time for arrival at Dong Hoi. I finally got out of bed at 7 and sat down with the rest of the members of the compartment. Vendors came around to sell breakfast and water. Beautiful sceneries passed outside the window. Railways are so much better than taking buses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Countryside train-scenery&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire arrangement seemed pretty nice. However, I did not quite understand why something so basic as the railways was made so luxurious and expensive. If they could remove the air-conditioning to slash down the rates would that not be more beneficial to the population in general? Everything in Vietnam was air-conditioned; buses, trains, taxis. I just don&amp;rsquo;t not get the need for it.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>

&lt;p&gt;It seems like I had been planning a solo backpacking trip overseas for ages. In late May 2016, I finally took off for a trip through South East Asia like I had always wanted to. I was dismissive of all deterring arguments. I cared not what was happening to me or around me. This trip was all that mattered right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a flight from Bangkok in Thailand to Hanoi in Vietnam; from one capital city to another, both strikingly different in their character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-eventful-arrival&#34;&gt;An Eventful Arrival&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I slept uneasily and was aware on a growing commotion around me. I finally opened my eyes around 3:30 AM and decided to try my luck at the check in counter. There was a huge crowd thronging the entrance at the baggage check. All of them were Asian tourists with big cartons and bags. I got in one of the many &amp;ldquo;lines&amp;rdquo; that was heading towards the X-Ray machine. People were quietly and patiently pushing at the back of my leg with their trolleys. I really did not want to get into an argument this early in the morning so I bore with the unpleasant pokes on my calves. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s not just Indians who are stupid tourists. I would have said they were Chinese, but I did not know for sure. To my relief, they were taking a chartered flight so they had a different counter after the baggage check. Phew!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/8/7400/27895141090_5c74c8e322.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;airport-jam&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Early morning crowding&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked up to my counter with fluttering heart. I was preparing my answers in my head. In case you are wondering what it was all about, I did not have a flight out of Vietnam and online forums said that some flights had this stupid policy. AirAsia had already asked me for a return flight when I was boarding for Bangkok from Chennai so in case they denied me admission here, I would have to buy a flight out of Vietnam then and there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The woman at the counter asked me for my visa. I showed her the invitation letter that would get me a visa on arrival. She went through it and proceeded to print the ticket. It was not until she tagged my luggage that I breathed a sigh of relief. But could it be this easy for me? There was one more hurdle awaiting at the Vietnamese immigration. But for now, I was through! I found a seat to sit in and charge my gadgets while I read a book. When it was close to boarding time, I walked to the allotted gate number and watched the sun rise over the Don Mueang Airport. There were quite a few tourists travelling to Hanoi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7486/27895143870_3ccd8e6425.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;sunrise-don-mueang&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Sunrise over Don Mueang&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vietnam Tip #1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AirAsia does not require an onward ticket for flights to Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flight was uneventful as usual. I tried sleeping but I could not because my neck hung at a weird angle. The flight was short though, so I was satisfied with just resting with my eyes closed. At the airport everyone streamed to the visa counters. The first line was to get the application form in exchange for a photo and your passport. A board proclaimed that you needed, among other requirements, an onward flight to get a visa. Damn it! Then I went to fill in the application anyway. There were no pens provided, you were supposed to have one of your own. Luckily, I did. The application started out well enough, then it started asking me weird details. Names, addresses and birth dates of family members! They had already taken my passport but I was also assumed to remember all it&amp;rsquo;s details. I had to connect to the internet to access the scanned copy and now the ISP wanted to know my age and salary bracket! I was in WTF mode by the time I was done with the application. I was not the only one, many others on the desk were looking around flustered hoping to find a relevant answer in a neighbouring form. I went to submit the application and it was nonchalantly accepted and I was asked to wait. Now I was frustrated as to why they were not looking at the information I had put in with so much effort. I felt so stupid!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The line I was standing in proved unnecessary. In Vietnam you are not served when it&amp;rsquo;s your turn. You are called when it&amp;rsquo;s your turn to be served. A screen above the counter displayed the name of the next person supposed to approach for the visa. Welcome to Communism! One of the girls immediately ahead of me ripped 50 dollars while opening the envelope in which she was carrying it. And that was all the money she was carrying. Her friend had some more but she was 2 USD short of what was required. I was wondering how stupid people can be when the lady at the visa counter gave her the passport and told her it was okay. She basically got into the country for free. My WTF mode jumped up a few notches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was asked to pay 25 dollars as the stamping fee, which I did without ripping any bills. I was handed the passport with the visa. I proceeded to the immigration desk. The lady officer was getting her make-up fixed by a friend and I had to wait a few seconds before they noticed me waiting at the yellow line. She took my passport and looked at me a few times more than necessary. I guess she was having trouble connecting my bearded face with the clean-shaven one in the passport. She stamped the passport and handed it back. I walked on. Was I in? This should be it, right? Yes it was! I was in Vietnam without incident. Woohoo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I collected my bags from the baggage belt, got a few dollars converted to Vietnamese Dong and got a SIM card. I had read about public buses stopping at the airport and was wondering where to get one. Route number 7 passed by without stopping but I was supposed to take route 17 anyway. There was a board which said there was a bus stop ahead but the number 17 had been scratched off it. Another bus approached and stopped right in front of me; &lt;strong&gt;route number 86&lt;/strong&gt;. There was just a western hippie girl getting in and I asked her if this bus would go to the &lt;strong&gt;Old Quarters&lt;/strong&gt;. She said it would. Perfect! I got in and took a seat. The ticket costed me 30k VND (roughly 90 INR) for a drop close enough to the hostel I had booked. This was a fairly new service which had started by the city. I observed the people in the bus as we travelled the 25 odd kilometers to the city. As a first impression, the Vietnamese looked very much like the &lt;em&gt;pahadis&lt;/em&gt; back home and the kids were extremely cute!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Bus #86&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hanoi Tip #1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnam has Uber. But unless you are tugging along a ridiculous amount of luggage, you could easily take route 86 to the city. It stops immediately to the right of the terminal exit gate and costs 30k VND flat for anywhere in the city. It stops around the Hoan Kiem Lake in the Old Quarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;old-quarters&#34;&gt;Old Quarters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was staying in the Old Quarters of the city. It took me the rest of the evening but I was able to figure out what about this place reminded me so much of India. It was the haphazard nature of things. Everything in this city was a random concoction thrown together; the traffic; the violations; the smells; the lighting; the garbage strewn streets; the people calling out to you; the flavours; the parked cars; the colors; the sounds. The buildings were stunted, something that I liked a lot. I slowly walked to the hostel, managing the notorious traffic of the city with relative ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src=&#34;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that my hostel reception did was trying to sell me the Ha Long Bay tour. I was considering going to Ha Long Bay initially but now I was repelled by the idea. Too much hype. There was still some time to check in so I went to a restaurant nearby. I sat down and ordered some food. The first thing that the waiter got me was a glass of beer! And that is how I first had a &lt;strong&gt;Bia Hoi&lt;/strong&gt; experience! &lt;em&gt;Bia Hois&lt;/em&gt; are ubiquitous in the country. They are similar to the beer stations in Myanmar but serve you draught beer (&lt;strong&gt;fresh beer&lt;/strong&gt; as they call it) that can get you hammered in no time. I just had a glass though, and some food since I was starving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back to the hostel and checked in. The bed was pretty simple and basic. The facilities were clean. I had nothing to complain about other than the sales pitches by the reception and the lack of a socializing atmosphere. I got some USD exchanged at one of the banks and got a rate better than the airport. On the way back to the hostel, I got scammed by two women who were selling some sweets. I paid 100 kVND for something that must have been less than half the price. I was still getting my head around the massiveness of the numbers. The thousand is pretty redundant a figure in Vietnamese currency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hanoi Tip #2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beware of women forcing a seemingly sample savoury on you. In general, be extra alert around over friendly vendors in big cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vietnam Tip #2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ignore the thousand in VND. Think in terms of &lt;strong&gt;1000 VND or kVND&lt;/strong&gt; for quick conversions. 1 kVND is roughly 3 INR and 20-22 kVND is 1 USD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I caught up on some sleep and forced myself out of bed at 7 PM so as to not spoil my night. I went for a walk towards &lt;strong&gt;Hoan Kiem Lake&lt;/strong&gt;, a major attraction in Old Quarters. The lake was pretty and lit up with random lighting. There were people all around it, some walking, others running. The Vietnamese women are beautiful. If I had to compare, their beauty is much more &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; than the Thai. The Thai have an unreal dreamy touch to them. The Vietnamese beauty looks much more real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vietnam Tip #3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is usual to see topless men running in Vietnam. You get used to it in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7316/28071828452_23bce74325.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;hanoi-streets-7&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Endless stream of bikes!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went till the Lenin Park next. It was further south. While I sat to rest and charge my camera, a man came and started talking to me with his limited English. The usual population of Vietnam does not have a very good English. There was the usual hello and question of nationality. I was also trying to learn some Vietnamese words on Google Translate app. I left after a bit and walked around to see more people walking, jogging and skating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/8/7312/27895177210_d57976c893.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;lenin-park-2&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Skating at Lenin Park&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked back to the hostel and had my first &lt;strong&gt;Pho Bo&lt;/strong&gt; on the way. It was super awesome! Food in Vietnam is not really cheap though. At least not for tourists. A single meal from street side places cost me in the vicinity of 100 INR. The rates might be different for locals though. Charging tourists extra is a perfectly acceptable practice in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7295/28176398695_ca06ba4d63.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;pho-bo&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Pho Bo : first love in Vietnam&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;discovering-hanoi&#34;&gt;Discovering Hanoi&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I slept till 10 in the morning. The dorm room was nice that way; quiet and dark enough to sleep in; no rush or noisy dorm-mates. But the place is seriously lacking in atmosphere. It is ridiculously named a &amp;ldquo;party hostel&amp;rdquo;. I put on my clothes and went to the &lt;strong&gt;Bun Cha&lt;/strong&gt; place I had seen the last night. I sat in one of the two adjacent stops and was served with loads of food!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7588/27895180500_e2b47270d2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bun-cha&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Kevin hearts Bun Cha!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dish is simply &lt;strong&gt;WOW&lt;/strong&gt;. There is no adjective to describe this awesome food. It is one of the best mix of flavours that I have ever eaten. It is usually served with crab roll called &lt;strong&gt;nem cua be&lt;/strong&gt;. I was evidently overcharged though. That&amp;rsquo;s one of the problems with going to places without printed rates. I gained wisdom in exchange of 100 kVND.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vietnam Tip #4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are drawn to a place that seemingly has good food but no menus or printed rates, ask for the price before you order food. This saves you from unnecessary surprises and will help you get better deals even if you are evidently n00b. Also, there is no shame in fishing for a better rate, even in adjacent shops. Be shameless about saving your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked up to the Hoan Kiem Lake again. I went to the &lt;strong&gt;Ngoc Son Temple&lt;/strong&gt; built on one end of the lake. The ticket was reasonable and was the same for all visitors. The only difference in rates was for children and adults. It struck me as extremely unfitting, specially for a socialist country. Though I was benefitting from this, I still think that the country&amp;rsquo;s cultural heritage should be easily accessible to all sections of the country&amp;rsquo;s population. At 30 kVND, it was not really cheap enough for the poorer sections of society. I walked around the pretty temple. It was not very big and had a lot of Chinese looking designs. I took some pictures of people offering prayers and a kid troubling a sleeping cat. Vietnamese kids are really cute! 😄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting out, I sat on one of the many benches around the lake. A man came and sat next to me. His name was Lo. We talked for a bit about India, cars, bikes and their costs in the respective countries. Vietnam imports its vehicles and has a lot of taxes. Hence one comes across more motorcycles and scooters than cars. We talked about more random things but at the end of it I was not sure whether it was a genuine conversation or not because he pulled out a map from his pocket and offered to take me to see the museums on his bike. I said goodbye shortly afterwards and started walking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Parks and statues abound in Old Quarters&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked to the &lt;strong&gt;Temple of Literature&lt;/strong&gt;, Vietnam&amp;rsquo;s oldest university that had been turned into a temple for Confucius. The information brochure that I bought by paying extra at the ticket counter was a redundancy. There was no information in there but it served as a makeshift fan. 😜 There was a lot of Chinese influence here as well and the temple itself was heavily decorated with idols inside. I enjoyed walking around the pretty complex with the green gardens and Chinese lanterns hanging in decoration. I went to see some impressive art work in one of the souvenir shops but did not buy anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came out after a while and walked till the &lt;strong&gt;Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum&lt;/strong&gt; which was a short distance away. That thing is grand and impressive! There is a giant flag of Vietnam flying in front of the building and the mausoleum itself is off limits to the public. A few soldiers stood attention at the gates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a museum nearby which I had initially thought of seeing but I dropped the plan because of the unending stream of sweat that I was producing. The heat was not much but the humidity was making things unbearable. I decided to walk back, there is always a tomorrow. There were more beautiful structures on the way but I just kept walking. No more sightseeing for the day. I ate a Doner Kebab from a stall which stuffed the meat inside a regular bread instead of pita but it was nice and filling enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Doner Kebab&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at the hostel I washed up and sat downstairs sipping on a &lt;strong&gt;Hanoi Beer&lt;/strong&gt;. I wrote a bit and started drinking the free beer that the hostel was offering. It&amp;rsquo;s something of a norm in Hanoi for hostels to give free beer in the evening. The quality of the beer is suspect though. Two glasses of that made me lose all 3D perspective. I stayed away from those &amp;ldquo;fresh beer&amp;rdquo; kegs then on. Bottled beer was cheap enough. The hostel manager asked one of the guys sitting there to tell me what an amazing time he had had on the Ha Long Bay Tour. I was not taking a tour! Period. The guy was from London (West Ham) and had been to India for 3 weeks recently. It was his last day in Vietnam and he had not planned on his next country yet, which was weird since he planned to fly out. Richness!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked out to get something to eat. There was a place that served good &lt;em&gt;Pho&lt;/em&gt; near the hostel and I went to try it out. There was actually a queue to get your soup! I waited in the line and finally got a &lt;em&gt;Pho Bo&lt;/em&gt; for myself. It was not really much different from the one I had had in the simple shop the night before other than the amount of meat in it. Maybe my taste buds were not developed yet in the sense of differentiating between &lt;em&gt;Pho&lt;/em&gt; tastes. Anyway, I ate up and left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;The pho&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked up to another part of the town which was known for it&amp;rsquo;s night market. I had no idea what I was going to witness. I ran into the night life of the city. Literally every crossing was stuffed with &lt;em&gt;bia hois&lt;/em&gt; that overspilled into the street. There was usually a street performance going on as well in the middle of the crossing. Rock music, jazz, traditional Vietnamese music, electronic beats, etc. There was a lane dedicated to nightclubs. It was all completely unexpected for me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hanoi had seemed a very different city. An older man tapped on my shoulder and asked me where I was from. He was an American who lived in Vasant Vihar in Delhi. He worked for WHO. We talked for several minutes about India, racism, cricket and Tendulkar, etc. Then we shook hands and the conversation ended as abruptly as it had begun. A young boy offered me marijuana. I was unable to understand what he was saying initially because he did not look your typical drug peddler, but once I did, I laughed and waved him off.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;That&#39;s a traffic jam!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked around the entire area twice, clicking pictures and absorbing it all in. Then I returned to the hostel which had died as I had expected. I worked in the room for a bit and then went down to the reception to see the Euro match. There were two others who came to see the game, the West Ham guy and an Irishman who worked in the hostel. Around the 70th or 80th minute another guy joined us after his late night out. He was a Swede who lived in Yangon. We exchanged some Myanmar stories. He also expressed his surprise about a married Indian man he had met in a club who was trying to score with some Vietnamese girls. I could just smile apologetically in reply. We talked about random things for the remainder of the match and then went up to our respective rooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;couchsurfing&#34;&gt;Couchsurfing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got up late debating what I was to do today. I had not seen much of the city and was definitely not taking the Sapa or Ha Long Bay tour. I could go to Ha Long Bay by myself, or extend the stay in Hanoi by shifting into another hostel, or stay on here and deal with the pushy receptionist. After much mental tussle, I decided to damn it all and go to Ninh Binh. I still had time to make it to the station for the 1 o&amp;rsquo; clock train. I might get a ticket if I was lucky or would take a bus if I was not. Since I had time on my hands, I went to grab a &lt;strong&gt;Banh Mi&lt;/strong&gt; at one of the places that I had been recommended by Sodani. The &lt;em&gt;Banh Mi&lt;/em&gt; is a sandwich made in a French baguette bread. It was slightly dry for my taste but I was later to realise that Hanoi does not do the best &lt;em&gt;Banh Mis&lt;/em&gt; anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I had started walking back towards the railway station, I checked my phone for directions and found a message from Long. He had replied to my last night&amp;rsquo;s request on Couchsurfing. I am rather new to the community and barely have references to be considered but had tried my luck anyway. I stood in the shade of a tree and got in touch with him. A quick chat later, I was walking towards Hoan Kiem Lake to catch a bus to Linh Dam, the locality where Long stayed. I had no idea what to expect out of a host or what was expected of a surfer but I decided that this was as good as any time to find that out. A GPS and location fuck up meant that I had to walk an hour extra in the scorching sun and, flustered as I was, it was a respite to reach the apartment. Long&amp;rsquo;s flatmate, Tan, showed me in and then rushed out to give his exam. Long and Tan were university students. The apartment was a nice one with wooden desks and beds. It had the simplicity of a student&amp;rsquo;s house, something that I liked very much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a bath, exchanged a few words with Long and then dozed off for a couple of hours. I woke up later and went for a walk around the lake nearby. Long went to see his friends. We decided to sync up over messages since I did not have the house key and Tan was not back yet. The lake was a big one, though not really in the cleanest of conditions. The water level was somewhat low, perhaps awaiting the year&amp;rsquo;s rains. I did one complete circle around the lake. There were people playing pro level &lt;em&gt;jianzi&lt;/em&gt; and badminton, some were jogging (there were topless men again), and a little further people sat on small plastic chairs drinking sugarcane juice and looking at the lake. On the other side, there were people bathing their dogs and taking a swim in the lake. The water did not seem clean to me but they seemed to be having fun!. I saw a beautiful sunset with the sky lighting up in exquisite colours and being reflected in the lake.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Sunset&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat a while in a cafe waiting for Long to return. The first Euro match of the night was about to start so I sat there longer than I had intended to. Cafes are omnipresent in Vietnam and I had thought that would be expensive affairs but they were not! I drank a couple of coffees of different styles while watching the match. The Vietnamese coffee is strong and has a smooth chocolaty texture, very much like dark chocolate. I had a hot black one and a cold milk one which they call Ca Phe Sua Da. It is basically coffee mixed with some condensed milk and ice cubes put on it. This drink would go on to become my favourite beverage in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vietnam Tip #5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When in Vietnam, drink Vietnamese coffee!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tan was back by the time I returned to the apartment and Long was gone again. We talked a bit, about my travel in Vietnam and I tried to get some food recommendations out of him. Tan was trying to learn English properly. So was Long and the entire Couchsurfing thing was to that effect. I liked their enterprising spirit. They wanted to learn international languages and hosted tourists for that. English is supposedly taught in Vietnamese schools but it is apparently not good enough. There is a huge problem that the youngsters of the country are facing and a simple thing like lack of English speaking skills is robbing them of opportunity and international exposure. I wondered what I would have done had I been in their place; probably just sat on my ass and complained about the lack of facilities! We sat and talked some more later in the night over a late dinner. Long had returned by then. There was more of English and exchange of cultural information. Vietnam has a weird form of socialism. I had supposed that everything basic would be provided for by the government but it was not so. The students had a tough life here. We stayed up and watched the late night Euro match between England and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;temples-pagodas-and-uncle-ho-s-legacy&#34;&gt;Temples, Pagodas and Uncle Ho&amp;rsquo;s Legacy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wooden bed was not as uncomfortable as it had looked. I managed a good enough sleep but woke up early. I freshened up and had some breakfast with Tan. The student life in Vietnam is pretty unprivileged. I am not sure how the economics works but they don&amp;rsquo;t seem to have a lot. He told me about the dishes that are made for breakfast in Vietnam and how they don&amp;rsquo;t have them &amp;ldquo;because they are students&amp;rdquo;. Leftover from last night, if any, is what they have for breakfast. That was good enough for me as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After breakfast I decided to complete the pending sightseeing and went back to the Old Quarter in the bus. I got off at Hoan Kiem lake and walked towards the Mausoleum. It was lunch hours so I walked ahead to the &lt;strong&gt;West Lake&lt;/strong&gt;. There were a couple of temples marked on the map which I intended to check out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;West lake&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first temple was &lt;strong&gt;Den Quan Thanh&lt;/strong&gt;. There was a small fee of 10 kVND to go in. The temple looked empty but for two women who were sitting on a bench. As I clicked photos, they came to me asking whether I wanted my photograph clicked with the temple. I did not. Then she asked me if I wanted to buy postcards from her. She pushed a few in my hands and I went through them for a few seconds saying that I would consider after seeing the temple. She got pushy now, saying that she needed to go for lunch so I should buy immediately. But I said I would skip in that case. She claimed that I must buy because I looked at the postcards. I laughed and handed it back. Then the other woman asked me to buy something for some baby which I cannot see. I was not amused. They went away with the look that said I had ruined their day. Of course I had. The temple was a nice and quiet one apart from this one pushy saleswoman. There were hardly any tourists around. The temple had a few spooky looking golden statues in red light.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Tranquil Quan Tanh Temple&lt;/em&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Spooky idols&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next temple, a little ahead was the &lt;strong&gt;Chua Tran Quoc&lt;/strong&gt;. This was supposedly the oldest temple in Vietnam; well maintained and renovated. There was no fee of admission though a board invited donations. There were lots of people here, tourists and locals. A catfight had broken out between two elderly women right outside the complex as I was passing by. It was mildly funny. There was a man standing at the main door and ruining the shot. He was in the same spot, working on his phone even when I came out. Inside there was an assortment of relics. There were inscriptions, beautiful bonsai sceneries, a 11 spired (I think that&amp;rsquo;s the count) tower with Buddha images inside, a Bodhi Tree gifted by Dr. Rajendra Prasad when he visited as the President of India. The main temple itself was small and similar to the last one. I spent a pleasant fifteen minutes looking around and walking in the complex.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;There is always an asshole spoiling the shot&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked back to the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum next. I came across the entry to the Presidential Palace and checked it out first. The was the house that Ho Chi Minh used to live in when he was the President of the state. It was a real palace. That man lived in style! I am not too sure how socialism works but here it just seemed like a mellowed down form of Feudalism. I walked around the pretty palatial complex and then exited.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;Uncle Ho&#39;s Palace. More in the album below.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up next was the museum. It was little more than the glorification of socialist values and their great leader. I was not expecting much else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;A temple of socialism&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was the legend of how Uncle Ho voyaged across the world and came to realise that socialism was the means to liberate his people from French colonialism and American capitalism. He made his way back to Vietnam and rid it of it&amp;rsquo;s oppressors. Some graphs of fudged numbers showed how socialism has worked wonders in consistently improving the economy and the people&amp;rsquo;s standard of living. The rest of it was a really quirky museum. There was a lot of modern art and some creepy looking things on display. I suppose Uncle Ho was a patron of arts, otherwise it would make little sense to make such a big museum full of it. I liked the air conditioning though and it helped me relax after the tiring day in the sun.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;em&gt;VIDEO : Spooky!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked back to the Hoan Kiem Lake to find a lot of tourists around the bus stand. Just when I was wondering why the tourists were taking the bus, I saw that they were all headed to &lt;strong&gt;Lotus Opera&lt;/strong&gt;. It was time for the &lt;strong&gt;Water Puppet Show&lt;/strong&gt;. I debated whether to go for it but I was not in a condition to enjoy more touristy activities. A young man started talking to me at the bus stand. He was confused as to why I was standing at the bus stand. When I told him that I was waiting for the bus, he asked me whether I lived in Hanoi. The part where I was staying with Long was not one that tourists frequented. I tried explaining Couchsurfing to him but eventually gave up saying that it was like Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at the apartment, Long and Tan were not in but another friend of their&amp;rsquo;s opened the gate. There was another Couchsurfer (French guy) who had come in the meanwhile. I took a bath and had started writing when Tan&amp;rsquo;s friend came and started talking. He is an automobile parts dealer in Vietnam and wanted to know if he could import parts from India to sell them in Vietnam. I had no idea of the industry and his English was not good. We made use of a translation app on his phone to understand each other. The marvels of technology! I went back to the cafe nearby to see the Croatia and Turkey match. The coffee was so good! ☕&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modric ripped Turkey apart. By my counting, there were at least three of him playing on the field! Amazing. Then I went to eat some dinner on Tan&amp;rsquo;s recommendation. &lt;strong&gt;Banh Cuon Nong&lt;/strong&gt;. It was an amazing dish that might have been a delicacy in another part of the world. It was rolls made of thin rice sheets with stuffing inside. One was supposed to dip it in the sweet and sour sauce that was provided and eat it up. The dish costed me a mere 20 kVND.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;postimg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7393/28097702931_c6aa71a03c.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;banh-cuon-nong&#34;&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Kevin eats Banh Cuon Nong. Do you?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dinner I went back up and chatted with another of Long&amp;rsquo;s friends. These guys invite their friends over to practice English with tourists. It&amp;rsquo;s a really nice arrangement. Long, his friend, the French guy (Rudy) and I went for some beer later. The weather was nice outside owing to sudden showers. We drank some super cheap beer and talked about the three countries : Vietnam, France and India. The topics ranged from weather and snow to population and number of children per generation. We sat a while and then returned to the apartment in hushed steps and voices. Bachelors and students are stigmatized everywhere I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;moving-on&#34;&gt;Moving On&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The French guy was gone by the time I woke up. I packed up as well. An Italian couple had just come in. They had been travelling overland from Italy for 10 months now. They intended to go to India in August and spend a couple of months there to end their trip. I find such stories so fascinating and impressive!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had another plate of &lt;em&gt;Banh Cuon Nong&lt;/em&gt; before catching a bus till &lt;strong&gt;Giap Bat Bus Station&lt;/strong&gt;. The touts jumped on me offering me tickets to Ninh Binh. I bought an extremely unauthentic looking ticket from one of them for the price that I had researched. One guy walked me to the bus and I took the last seat. Another man tried selling me lighters and bracelets. I just smiled and shook my head. The bus started and the journey was comfortable enough. They were playing &amp;ldquo;Ipman 2&amp;rdquo; on the TV. There was a strange Vietnamese voice over. A single person (a woman) had done it for all the characters in monotone. It was a good thing that I knew the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched the Vietnamese countryside for a bit. It is very similar to certain parts of India. There are the green fields with concrete structures peppered throughout. Tarred highways with fast cars racing on them. Billboards advertising things that aspired you to afford them. The only considerable difference seemed that the houses here had slanting roofs instead of flat tops back in India.&lt;/p&gt;
