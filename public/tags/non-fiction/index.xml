Adam Frank&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/176825.Adam_Frank&#34;&gt;Adam Frank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My rating: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1075964513&#34;&gt;4 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learnt about this book from another pop-physics book that I had read, Lee Smolin&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Trouble With Physics&amp;rdquo;. I never got around to getting to the book though. Recently I bought this book as a gift for a colleague and thought I would give it a shot first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;About Time&amp;rdquo; is exactly what it says it is. It is a recap of time, as we have seen it through the ages, back when we were cave men down to the current millisecond era of computers. Adam Frank tells the story of how time and it&amp;rsquo;s perception has been tied to our cultural advancements. He talks about various scientific experiments that have changed the way we have perceived time and our universe. The book is about the universe and it&amp;rsquo;s biggest mystery, time. Frank ties all the scientific, technological and cultural milestones to present the reader with a bigger picture of how our understanding of universe and time has advanced over generations to reach where it is today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam Frank is an excellent storyteller. There was never a dull moment in the entire book, which is a very surprising thing when it comes to books about science. But the book was not oversimplified either. It gave all the necessary facts and enough details so that the curious could grab the concept, without going into the technical jargon that makes one lose interest. I personally found it rather entertaining and well laid out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My rating: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1079709095&#34;&gt;3 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was advised about reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/8120306872/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3626&amp;creative=24790&amp;creativeASIN=8120306872&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=readings0c-21&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Philosophy of Religion&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; by an uncle of mine as a response to another &lt;a href=&#34;http://fleetingnonsense.blogspot.com/2014/10/of-religion-and-science.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;. I had put it on my reading list and even got myself a copy but the dry schoolbook-like text had put me off the task of reading it for quite a while. Eventually I did get to it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book starts of in a rather dry fashion, but you need to remember that this is primarily an academic text. The author goes into great detail about the concept of God as seen in the Judaic-Christian way. Then he expounds on multiple theories that have been proposed to support and to deny the existence of such a being. It was on limited interest to me because I belonged to a household of different faith before turning agnostic. But it did shed some very interesting light on the way that human beings tend to see God. Towards the end the book did get more interesting when it got to the concept of religion and the various contradictory claims by the many religions in the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book is in no way exhaustive and I do not suppose any book can ever be comprehensive on such a varied and evolving subject. But I felt that the book was primarily designed for the followers of Christian faith in order to understand their religion and God better. In parts it was interesting but overall a rather dry book. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s use is limited to the academia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My rating: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1591799330&#34;&gt;3 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend recently told me that he had read Dr. Pattanaik&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9864913-jaya&#34;&gt;Jaya&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; and had found it quite interesting. I had been meaning to read it for some time and found myself browsing through the shelves of the bookstore at Jaipur airport for the book. Of course they had it, but another book caught my eye. &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22697803.Shikhandi_and_Other_Stories_They_Don_t_Tell_You&#34; title=&#34;Shikhandi and Other Stories They Don&#39;t Tell You by Devdutt Pattanaik&#34;&gt;Shikhandi and Other Stories They Don&amp;rsquo;t Tell You&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; seemed to be quite interesting so I got it instead. &amp;ldquo;Jaya&amp;rdquo; would have to wait for another time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was immensely impressed by Devdutt Pattanaik&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://bookedvorm.blogspot.in/2014/05/mythmithya-dr-devdutt-pattanaik.html&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&gt;myth=mithya&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;. He seemed to be one of those sensible mythologists who seek out the history in mythology. This book tried to justify the LGBT movements that India saw recently in terms of Hindu religion and mythology. Dr. Pattanaik uses the word queer to refer to any sexuality that is not sanctioned by the major religions. Though the usage of the word might seem a bit ironic, especially when the author is arguing that the queer are just as natural as the non-queer, but if you rid the word of all the negative connotations that it has gathered over time, it is just another word. The book looks into all the twisted stories from various mythological sources of Hindu cultures across India and tries to establish that diversity in genders and sexuality are not only present from times immemorial but are also accepted and celebrated by the pantheon of Hindu gods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book talks about gods and men who find themselves in a position to do many of the acts that modern religions (including modern Hinduism) find inappropriate and unnatural. These include acts of changing gender, same sex love, cross dressing, castration to fit a role and many such acts that seem outrageous to our trained minds. All these acts are either done out of volition or as a result of a curse or boon. But never are the subjects of such action frowned upon or outlawed in these stories. Dr. Pattanaik also tells how and why such stories have been suppressed from popular mythology or modified to more suitable forms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The short read was quite impressive in terms of showing how stories are forgotten when the popular culture does not support them. It was also quite interesting from a point of view of curiosity as it shows the diversity that the Hindu folk lore contain. However, reading the book I felt that Dr. Pattanaik is not an unbiased observer. He is rather someone who holds Hinduism in a higher esteem than other ways of life. Not that there is anything wrong with it, especially when it is being used to bring about a change in the uptight style of living that the monastic order has made popular. But this attitude also tends to distort the interpretation of mythology and things get modified in translation.&lt;/p&gt;
