<p>India is abuzz with the newly discovered culture of travel and as more and more of the curious ones start putting on their shoes and strapping on their backpacks, the erstwhile popular tourist destinations have started becoming overcrowded and have started losing a bit of their charm. While the developed tourist infrastructure favours the ones looking for easy travel options and guided tours, not all of us subscribe to that format of travel. For some, true bliss can be only be found far from the overcrowded destinations and the pushy touts.</p>

<p>North Eastern India is currently drawing a lot of attention from tourists all over the country who are looking for alternate destinations to travel. Meghalaya in particular is immensely popular because of the ease of connectivity it has through Guwahati&rsquo;s airport and the plethora of experiences it can provide to the ones looking in the right places. You can essentially pitch your base in Shillong or Sohra (erstwhile Cherapunjee) and do day trips across the state. When Parul and I recently visited Meghalaya with friends, we were a little taken aback by how touristy the place was. As is our nature, we started looking for less touristy things to do in order to avoid the crowd and the repetitive experiences. Here is a short list that we managed to compile for anyone who wishes to experience Meghalaya without being a part of the heavy tourist waves.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="road-trip">Road Trip</h2>

<p>The road is probably the best way to enjoy Meghalaya. The state has amazing roads and riding a bike or driving a car here is the best way to enjoy the sceneries. I recommend this despite admitting that the ML number plate is backed by some of the worst drivers. Perhaps my judgement of them was slightly biased because we had just come from Arunachal where the road sense are amazing. But trust me, I have ridden on many roads in this country across multiple states and having spent the last few years in Pune, I know what bad driving is. Meghalaya has it bad, really bad.</p>

<p>However, the sparsely crowded roads and the amazing sceneries more than compensate you for the bad drivers. I recommend riding because of an obvious bias for two wheels but I guess driving a car would be just as pleasurable.</p>

<h2 id="nongriat">Nongriat</h2>

<p>Not very far from the maddening crowd of Sohra is a little village called Nongriat. The famed &lsquo;Double Decker&rsquo; living root has made this village quite popular but the short hike after a descent of approximately 2000 stairs deters some of the faint hearted tourists.</p>

<p>Nongriat is an excellent place to spend a couple of days. There are multiple hikes that originate from this small hamlet. The Rainbow Falls is the most popular one. We did this and were lucky enough to see the sun come out and form a rainbow at the base of the falls.</p>

<p>On the way back to Nongriat the stream forms a natural swimming pool, the Blue Lagoon. It&rsquo;s a perfectly nice place to chill for hours at end. The water is cold and refreshing and the pool deep enough to indulge in some bufoonery. [:&rsquo;D]</p>

<p>You can also hike till the base of the Nohkalikai Falls. We did not do this but having seen the falls from up above, it seemed like the hike would have been quite amazing.</p>

<h2 id="mawlynnong">Mawlynnong</h2>

<p>Asia&rsquo;s cleanest village (by some standard) has managed to attract an unreal amount of tourists. The village has also adapted itself accordingly, with stalls at every nook and corner selling the same goods.</p>

<p>However, there are hikes to be done around the village which are quite amazing. We did one that was recommended by my brother, [@tra.ve.la]() who had been here a few years back when Mawlynnong saw occasional tourists.</p>

<p>The hike took us through a village and a small roots bridge to the Urkyrming Waterfalls. The waterfall was quite impressive with multiple cascading levels. There was a small cave where one can get in behind the falls for a closer look.</p>

<p>The highlight of the hike, however, was the Bamboo Bridge. A short walk upstream the river bed we reached a beautiful and calm spot with a bamboo bridge suspended over a pool of sparkling clean water. I was quite tempted to take a dive into the blue water but the depth of the pool was a little unnerving. [:P] We did enjoy the waters from the side though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One can pick up a guide from the village for Shillang Jashar and the Bamboo Bridge</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="shnongpdeng">Shnongpdeng</h2>

<p>Dawki, a small town on the Bangladesh border in West Jaintia hills, is popular for the river of the same name that flows through it. The Dawki river&rsquo;s clean green waters offer a surreal visualization of the rocky river bed from up above, justifying the popularity of the boat tourism in the area. However, Dawki attracts far too much crowd for our liking.</p>

<p>A few kilometers upstream is the small village of Shnongpdeng. Nestled on the slope of the hill overlooking the river bed, Shnongpdeng offers some decent homestays and camping facilities for the travelers who reach that far.</p>

<p>You can enjoy kayaking in the Dawki river here. However, the kayaking area is limited due to the fishing lines spread out upstream but it is a nice experience anyway. To experience more of the valley, you can opt for a boat ride. It is reasonably priced and lasts for the better part of an hour.</p>

<p>There are more adventure activities on the offer here. There is the zipline across the river which seemed like fun but was quite overpriced. Then there is the &ldquo;cliff jump&rdquo; which seemed more like a <em>rock jump</em> after the jump I had done in Rishikesh.</p>

<p>If nothing else, you can enjoy a nice and calm swim in the river or chill on the rocks by the riverside and indulge in some stargazing.</p>

<h2 id="krang-shuri">Krang Shuri</h2>

<p>Alright. This one is not really off the tourist grid but it is mighty fun!</p>

<p>Around an hour from Shnopdeng and two from Shillong, Krang Shuri waterfalls is a pretty little fall with a cavern behind it. The highlight of this place, however, is the swim in the pool with deep blue waters.</p>

<p>It is highly recommended that you pay it a visit, put on a lifejacket, jump in and enjoy a nice swim. You can even find a spot where you can pass under the falling water and feel a &ldquo;head-thumping&rdquo; massage, reminding you of your local roadside barber. [:&rsquo;D]</p>

<h2 id="shillong-and-around">Shillong and Around</h2>

<h3 id="cafes-clubs-and-eateries">Cafes, Clubs and Eateries</h3>

<p>Shillong has the charms of a hill station and the comforts that are otherwise missing in the rustic state. The cafe culture out here is quite impressive and you can find some of the most pleasant places to spend your day chatting with friends or getting some work done. There is no dearth of options but our favourite of the lot was <strong><em>Hoitea Toitea</em></strong>, a relatively new cafe which overlooks the city&rsquo;s oldest swimming pool. The ambience and the music are just perfect.</p>

<p>And since you would be on Khasi land it makes sense to try their signature food. If you are not a vegetarian, pay a visit to <strong><em>Trattoria</em></strong> in Police Bazaar to taste some amazing Khasi food (pork preferably). There are plenty of other food options available in the city which would appeal to every taste.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Evening Club</em></strong> gave us a very memorable night with some live music and good food. This place has a history to it and has been at the heart of Shillong&rsquo;s music scene for a very long time now. On the weekends, you can find some band or the other performing in cafes across the town. A special mention to <strong><em>Dylan&rsquo;s Cafe</em></strong> as well for providing us the pleasure of burgers after a long long time. [:D]</p>

<h3 id="don-bosco-museum">Don Bosco Museum</h3>

<p>An extremely well done museum that should be on your list if you are visiting Shillong. It will help you understand the various people of North East India and their diverse culture. The seven floors of information is topped (literally) with a skywalk where you can see the city of Shillong sprawled in front of you.</p>

<h3 id="laitlum-canyon">Laitlum Canyon</h3>

<p>If there is one place around Shillong that you should go to, it is the Laitlum Canyons. Dubbed as the &ldquo;Grand Canyon of India&rdquo;, this place has an eternal feel to it. The canyon stretches far and wide and makes for a picture perfect scenery. You can climb the path down to the river below or chill on the top taking in the scenery for hours at end. There are even some maggi points here to stack up on the experience.</p>

<hr />

<p>While Meghalaya has indeed started seeing a lot of tourist activity, it is not very difficult to go off the beaten track. Just head away from the crowds and ask the locals for recommendations [;)]</p>
