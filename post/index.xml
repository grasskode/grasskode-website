      <description>A few weeks back, Aniket asked me if I wanted to write an introduction for his new book. I did not have to think twice to know that I definitely wanted to write something. It had been a long time since I had something definite to write about and it was probably the first time I was writing for someone else. I was thrilled, to say the least.
The piece did not come easy though.</description>

      <description>About Time: From Sun Dials to Quantum Clocks, How the Cosmos Shapes Our Lives - And How We Shape the Cosmos. Adam Frank by Adam Frank
My rating: 4 of 5 stars
I learnt about this book from another pop-physics book that I had read, Lee Smolin&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Trouble With Physics&amp;rdquo;. I never got around to getting to the book though. Recently I bought this book as a gift for a colleague and thought I would give it a shot first!</description>

This was another one that came out of the shelf cleaning session. It had been recommended to me a coupe of days earlier and had seemed extremely interesting so I took it up almost immediately. This was a paperback as well, an old copy with yellowing pages and the smell of old paper that I love. Tells you how books are a pleasure more than just reading.</description>

I don&amp;rsquo;t quite remember how I had come across this book but I think it was through a reference in another. Anyway, the title was quite interesting and I picked it bought it in my kindle library. I picked it up while I was backpacking and while I had intended to complete the book in the duration, it was not to be so.</description>

In a recent cleaning exercise, out of the recesses of old bookshelves, came out this beauty. It had been a while since I had taken up a paperback and my current read, &amp;ldquo;The Man Without Qualities&amp;rdquo; seemed to be going nowhere. Since this seemed like a book that I could be done with a a few days, I decided to make it an interim read.</description>

      <description>I was travelling in Vietnam recently and towards the end of the third week in the country, reached the amazing city of Da Lat. It was here that I met Mandy and she told me the English tuition center that she worked for was looking for foreign teachers. I knew about such jobs but I also knew that they usually required a certification in TEFL (or TESOL) or for a nativity of the language.</description>

      <description>My Phases of Belief I was brought up in a devout Hindu household and very enthusiastically participated in the havans and poojas that happened often in the house. I had the prayers memorised and the Hindu pantheon was full of the most awesome gods that might put the superheroes of the Marvel and DC universe to shame. In short, I had a normal upbringing that any child born in a religious household has.</description>

      <description>Philosophy of Religion by John Harwood Hick
My rating: 3 of 5 stars
I was advised about reading &amp;ldquo;Philosophy of Religion&amp;rdquo; by an uncle of mine as a response to another post. I had put it on my reading list and even got myself a copy but the dry schoolbook-like text had put me off the task of reading it for quite a while. Eventually I did get to it.</description>

      <description>Today was a sad day for any genuine football fan. Messi retired from Argentina&amp;rsquo;s national side. He is probably the greatest player that the sport has seen (and I am not going to get into debates about possible contenders) and anyone who genuinely cares about the sport will take this news like a punch in the face.
I had lost my starry-eyed adulation for Messi some time back. Seeing his &amp;ldquo;magic&amp;rdquo; was becoming something of a rarity as his performance was dipping and teams were learning how to counter him on the field.</description>

      <description>On the culture (or lack of it) in Indian startups.
I have been involved with Indian startups in some capacity or the other since I was in college. The involvement has been a personal one, through some of my closest friends or through the circles I have frequented in this time.
The Indian Startup Scene Some estimate the number of startups in India to be more than 19,000, and that is just the number of startups in the technology domain.</description>

      <description>Shikhandi and Other Stories They Don&amp;rsquo;t Tell You by Devdutt Pattanaik
My rating: 3 of 5 stars
A friend recently told me that he had read Dr. Pattanaik&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Jaya&amp;rdquo; and had found it quite interesting. I had been meaning to read it for some time and found myself browsing through the shelves of the bookstore at Jaipur airport for the book. Of course they had it, but another book caught my eye.</description>

My rating: 2 of 5 stars
I thought I had sworn off Ghosh for good. But an uncle (the same one who had lent me his copy of &amp;ldquo;In An Antique Land&amp;rdquo;) told me to pick this book since I was about to go to Burma. With a rather divided mind I eventually got a kindle version of this book and started reading it a few days prior to my departure to the &amp;ldquo;Land of Gold&amp;rdquo;.</description>
