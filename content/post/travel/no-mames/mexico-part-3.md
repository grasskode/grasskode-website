We took an ADO bus out of Oaxaca which would get us to San Cristobal de Las Casas overnight. Weirdly sleeper buses are not a concept out there but fortunately the ADO buses are luxurious enough to spend the night comfortably. Parul slept as soon as the bus hit the highway but I stayed up initially, trying to test my Spanish against a movie that was being played. Come morning, we were at our destination.

<hr />


## Ahh! San Cristobal!

We walked for around half an hour to get to our AirBnB. I think Parul has caught on to my fascination for walking; or maybe just given up on me :stuck_out_tongue:

The AirBnB was at quite a distance from the Zocalo in a secluded residential area which was still not completely developed. We saw a skateboard rink on the way and something that looked like a sports complex.

Our hostess, Rosario, welcomed us and allowed us an early check-in. She fed us some fresh quesadillas and tea while we chatted about India, China and other unrelated things. This was going to be our only interaction with her but we did not mind. The accommodation was a beautiful adobe house with it's independent access and we loved the look and feel of it. It had been a while since we had gotten time for ourselves :smile:

We took a short nap and then headed to the centro. There was a certain expectation we had from this town. Every traveller we had shared our plans with on the road had inevitably sighed at the mention of **San Cristobal de Las Casas**.

> "Ahh! San Cristobal!" they would all say and then their eyes would visibly twinkle and zone out. Their minds lost themselves to, what I supposed were, pleasant memories. "You're going to love it there!" they'd finally say after a few moments with the broadest smile on their faces.

This had happened too many times to be a personal experience of a single traveller. It seemed to be the general sentiment of the travel community in this country! It did not take us long to figure out why.

  <em>Images from the street</em>
</div>

San Cristobal initially seemed to me to be a smaller version of Oaxaca City. But as we walked around, there seemed to be more and more to this small town. The centro was small and colourful which gave loads of opportunities for street photography. Characters from Middle Earth - Gandalf and elves - stood around, offering a picture with themselves in exchange for a tip. There were artists dressed as shamans and performing high energy dances for an awed audience. Street vendors sold clothes and items of food. Hippies sold chocolates and strummed their guitars. And of course there was the *cafe* and *xocolate* that Chiapas is so popular for. It was a little bit of everything stuck into the small and vibrant city center.

We checked out a couple of museums (as we must!). One of jade and another of cacao. Neither was mind-blowing but the [Jade Museum](https://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g150802-d2090857-Reviews-Museo_Mesoamericano_del_Jade-San_Cristobal_de_las_Casas_Southern_Mexico.html) had a really good recreation of the tomb of Pacal that we would see later at Palenque.

We climbed up the hill to the west of the city where sat **Iglesia de San Cristobalito**. In the retiring day, it was a nice climb which gave a beautiful view of the city. The colourful flags hanging over the stairway made the climb somewhat less tiring :sweat_smile:

After sunset we came back down and spent some more time at the centro before finally heading back to the AirBnB. That too because the vegan lunch that we had had was not letting us sit and eat/drink in a cafe (damn vegan food! :grimacing:) We picked up some pizza and mezcal on the way back and finished [Roma](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/roma_2018) (which we had started in Oaxaca at the recommendation of Fernando and Marianna) before calling it a night.

## People of the Land

The next morning we had scheduled a tour with [Alex y Raul](https://www.facebook.com/AlexyRaulTours/) to Zinacantan and Chamula. This was a culture tour and had come highly recommended by our hostess. We decided to give it a shot in order to understand the culture of the land better. Would definitely be something different from what we were used to. We reached the Zocalo at 9:30 AM and were met by our guide, Cesar. The group was a small one. A four member family from Netherlands and the two of us. We learnt over the course of the tour that they were doing a road-trip across the Yucatan and had come inland as far as Chiapas.

The tour started at **Zinacantan**, a community of _Tsotsil_ speaking Mayans who had adopted Christ and his ways. We walked around the church first, which seems to form the crux of all towns in Mexico. The town's main church was under restoration so they had shifted into a temporary one.

  <em>The temporary church at Zinacantan</em>
</div>

There was a wedding going on and Cesar asked us to passively observe it from the side. Everyone here, Cesar explained, wore something like a uniform which was typical to their village. Every community or village in the area had it's own uniform of sorts so that you could immediately tell where the people were from by simply looking at them. This village had adopted Christianity widely and held on to a few traditions as well. They had their unique justice system headed by three elected judges from the village. The children went out to study and work. The village was liberal in many ways, the community system was strong and everyone devoted a year to community services. The customs of this village reminded me of Khonoma (Nagaland) in many ways.

We went to visit a family of weavers next. Every village had it's own typical designs and the women of the family weaved various articles using traditional techniques which made the production slow and laborious. Opening the house to tours was a way for them to gain supplementary income. Everyone was comfortable with cameras and getting clicked except for the eldest granny who was around 90 years old and not very fond of the camera :older_woman:

Parul bought a tote bag from the weavers on our way out. We headed to the van which ferried us to our next destination. **Chamula** was a different part of the land and, as was to be expected, the clothes of the people here changed to reflect the change in location. The town was much bigger than Zinacantan. The people here also spoke Tsotsil but were much more conservative about their traditions than the people of Zinacantan. Cesar explained the various differences as we walked in front of the massive church and then took us inside, warning that the people here did not appreciate the camera so we had better put it away. It was an extremely surreal experience to walk in that church. The people had adopted the Christian God and saints but modified them to fit into their traditional belief. Candles burnt everywhere in the church and hay lined the floors. People sat chanting and shamans carried out rituals to heal the sick. The Vatican had tried interfering a few times to establish it's version of Christianity but the locals had violently repelled it away.

Cesar took us to see a spiritual leader next. These were people who served the community and were selected based on application. They held special positions in the society but a lot of them had to save their entire lives to gather the funds required for a year long service as a spiritual leader. As the incense burnt and the spiritual leader chanted to gods hidden behind veils of leaves, Cesar commented on how this village had it's own way of functioning. How traditional medicine was still used here and was claimed to work. But missionaries from USA came and tried converting these people to their faith.

We went about to see the town's market and the local prison next. The prison cells were open to observation and Cesar explained how the justice system here was orthodox but effective. Severe crimes were punished by lynching and moderate ones by public shaming.

The tour ended at the town's graveyard where Cesar showed us the unique tombs of the natives. He emphasised how the natives had modified Christian beliefs to match their own and why they were not wrong in doing so.

I agreed with what Cesar was saying. The village had it's right to exist in the manner that it wished to. Modernization would bring about many changes for sure but adopting those changes was a choice of the natives. It should not be forced on them. This strong hold on the traditional way of life was probably the reason that [Zapatistas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapatista_Army_of_National_Liberation) were so firmly rooted in Chiapas. They were a bit like [Naxalites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naxalite) in India, only much more supported by the local communities and much more effective.

We thanked Cesar for the wonderful tour as he dropped us back to the city center. This had been an extremely insightful experience and we decided to do more of such culture tours whenever we could. There are things you do not understand as an outsider unless it is explained to you by a well informed local.

Back in San Cristobal, we had a wonderful lunch of soups in a restaurant where two old men played a [marimba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marimba) for our entertainment. Parul thought that one of them looked like [Robin Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Williams) when he smiled :smile:

We went back to the room and after resting a while we left for some Mexican food in a nearby restaurant followed by some drinks in the Zocalo. San Cristobal had our hearts :heart: We would now have the familiar response to anyone asking us about this magical place.

## Change in the Itinerary

We had a flight out from San Cristobal to Merida but we decided that we were rushing things too much. We had been having active days ever since Zicatela and both of us wanted to rest for a day or two. Plus, we wanted to see Palenque as well and had we gone to Merida as planned, Palenque would become too off route to pursue. So we decided that the flight was cheap enough to give a miss and extended a day in San Cristobal. This was today, when we decided to take it easy and do as little as we could.

We woke up to the chirping of birds in the fallow land next to our property. I spent many a minutes trying to click an elusive hummingbird with my zoom lens. The flora and fauna of Mexico is starkly different from Asia's and it is a treat in itself.

We also went to check out the Museum of Mayan Medicine which was on the other side of the town. This was strictly okay but we managed to have _tamales_ on the way. This staple dish is somewhat like upma and best had roadside with the corn drink _atole_. I made do with some coffee though.

In the afternoon Parul went back for a nap and I sat in a cafe editing pictures and drinking more coffee with chocolate. I returned to the AirBnB later and decided to go for a run in the sports complex nearby. This was the [SEDEM park](https://goo.gl/maps/NburBXiGSL2iUL3h8) and seemed to be quite an elaborate public amenity with football fields, a jogging track, basketball courts and more. While jogging around, I thought how it's things like these that make life so much more livable and enjoyable.

</div>

I ran a disastrous few laps and cursing myself for the bad shape I had gotten into, returned to the room. My phone had been misbehaving for a few days now and the battery finally died during the run. Frustrated, I swore off Motorola phones.

That night we went back to the city center to book a tour of the Sumidero Canyons and then book a ticket to Palenque with ADO. After getting done with all the bookings, we sat at [TierrAdentro](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/mexico/tabasco-and-chiapas/san-cristobal-de-las-casas/restaurants/tierradentro/a/poi-eat/433918/361649), a Zapatista cafe that Dahlia had suggested. Like all her suggestions, this turned out to be pretty amazing. There was live music, okay food and lots of drinks during the happy hours :smile:

## Doing it All Wrong

The next morning we packed up and waited in front of the SEDEM gate for the tour company to pick us up. We eventually got into a van full of Mexicans and headed to the **Sumidero Canyons**.

It seemed slightly odd to begin with but that was just because we were not used to tours. The driver ranted off information about the canyon in rapid Spanish and I tried to catch some words here and there. Once we reached the jetty, we were transferred into a motorboat and thus started two hours of the canyon tour.

There were strange formations on the cliff and the boat guide described these in rapid Spanish. We used to stop often at such "points of interest" and click pictures or benefit from the guide's knowledgeable rant. There were small caves and stalactites hanging from them. Egrets, pelicans and vultures flew around. It was quite surreal.

The tour would have been great ... except ... I had this constant feeling that we were doing it all wrong! Parul and I chatted at the end of the tour and she was feeling the same way. We should have been in kayaks, slowly making our way through the canyon. But a kayak or row-boat would have taken too long and who has the time these days? Get in a speed boat that noisily rushes through the canyon. Who cares about the fauna being disturbed by the sound or the rippling water or the smoke of the diesel engines? See everything in a rush, go click-click and leave with a bucket list tick. Mass tourism is a menace indeed! This could have been so much better. Too bad that it wasn't but we learnt to trust our guts for the next time. We had been super indecisive about the canyons and we now realised it was for good reason. We also decided to be more responsible in the future and do our due research in such cases.

After the canyons, the tour van stopped at **Chiapa de Corzo**, a town nearby which probably deserved a couple of days to itself. We had some interesting lunch at one of the home owned restaurants.

Then we sat in the central park chatting, clicking pictures and commenting on things that did not need our knowledgeable input :stuck_out_tongue:

<hr />

The rest of the day was all about killing time till our bus later that night. I got my phone in working condition by a local repair center (there are no official Motorola repair centers in the whole of Mexico :expressionless:). It was working now and I just hoped that it lasted till the end of the trip. We sat at a Starbucks to use their good internet and worked on the blogs. Eventually it was time for the bus and we headed to the ADO bus stand right outside the town center.
