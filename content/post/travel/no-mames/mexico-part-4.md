## Hues of Blue

We woke up next morning later than we had planned to. This was becoming a routine now :grimacing: I made some breakfast of the things we had in the kitchen and we packed up and left. There was a random [tripadvisor post](TODO) that I had run into while searching for a cheap and local way to travel to our next destination and we decided to try it out first instead of taking the longer option later in the day. Fortunately, we were still in time to get a _camioneta_ for Zapata that got us there in time for the 10:30 bus to Chetumal. We reached Chetumal later in the afternoon via some beautiful and green roads and barely any civilization enroute. After a super late lunch at a Subway, we caught a _colectivo_ to **Bacalar**. It was by 7 PM in the evening that we dragged our tired selves into the AirBnB. It was a basic one but it would serve our needs. We would soon find out that Bacalar was much more expensive than the Mexico we had been travelling in so far. Later that night we walked out to see the _centro_, have some dinner of _quesadillas_ and then landed at the [Yak Hostel](TODO) to book a sailing cruise for the next afternoon.

We spent the next morning in a cafe. Starbucks had come to mean good and reliable internet for us in this country. I am always amazed at how far ahead India is in terms of internet connectivity than most of the world. I downloaded [Civ6](TODO) which had been lying around in my steam library waiting for some good download bandwidth and I would be addicted to the game for at least a few days to come :laughing:

At 2:30 in the afternoon we went to the Yak Hostel and waited for the sailing trip to start. The Bacalar Lagoon stretched out infront of us. It was called the Lagoon of Seven Colours because it sported seven hues of blues in very distinct strips. It was quite surreal to see and extremely pleasing and soothing.

The Bacalar Lagoon as seen from the Yak Hostel

Eventually our sailboat arrived and we boarded it with two Dutch girls and _el capitan_ Miguel. The sails caught wind and we slowly moved into the depper parts of the lagoon. The blues of the lagoon changed colour with the underlying depth. The wind felt nice and I was reminded on the paraw cruise I had done in Boracay a few years back. Miguel, however, kept the boat from speeding and we enjoyed the slow ride on the blue waters.

A growing love for water

We stopped at one of the cenotes that was in the lagoon. The water there was darker and Miguel explained how the water came in from an underground source and due to the volcanic nature of the source, it was smelt and tasted of sulfides. We did not get into the water here but went to the shallower parts for a dip. This was next to the [Pirates Channel](TODO). There were broad areas that you could stand in, and splash around. More sailboats and motorboats had started appearing in the lagoon and there was a general atmosphere of gaiety where we stopped.

:kissing_closed_eyes:

While we clicked pictures and floated around, Miguel crafted a delicious fruit salad for us. All of us shared stories of our travels and Miguel told us how he had been sailing since he was three years old. He was a Mexican brought up in Italy  and spoke Spanish, Italian, French and English. He had a seriously cool life goal as well - he wanted to buy a sailboat in Europe and sail it across the Atlantic to Mexico!

El Capitan

We got on the boat again and sailed into the lagoon. Miguel put on some music and everyone receded into their own thoughts, looking at the beautiful lagoon and the sun slowly dipping in the sky. We returned as the sun set and said our goodbyes ere the light left this small lagoon-side town in Mexico.

Sunset Cruise

We had dinner at Christian Tacos, right across the street from where we were staying, the place right opposite our AirBnB. The food was nice but their cocktails did not have any effect :grimacing: Perhaps we were developing a strong constitution when it came to alcohol. We suspected the Mezcal had something to do with it :joy:

## Falling in Love

We spent another day at the AirBnB. Bacalar, much like [Brisas de Zicatela](TODO), has acquired the patronage of the international travelling community. The lake and the laid back atmosphere across the town attracts travelers from the Americas and beyond. There is no dearth of good food to be had and we checked out some interesting restaurants and cuisines during the day.

Vegan lunch at Mango y Chile

We headed to the _centro_ that evening and decided to eat the pancake like thing that were being sold in carts. We had been seeing it since Palenque and it had piqued my interest. It was thus that we discovered _marquesitas_, one of the most affordable and beloved street food of Yucatan and adjoining area. It was a thin pancake filled with sweet or savoury fillings and rolled up to take on the go :yum:

Later we sat in a bar for a few drinks. The I Scream Bar was probably one of the most fun bars I have been to :smile: The bartender's mood was totally representative of the entire place :joy:

We had fallen in love with Bacalar during the two days we had spent here. And not we were thinking of extending our stay. Bacalar was a bit pricey so we decided to go ahead and splurge, one of the occasional luxuries we indulged in. So we booked a [lagoon-side villa](TODO) which was a little way away from the centro and checked out of our AirBnB the next morning.

The prettiness of it all

It was a small place with only a few guests and we enjoyed the dock constructed at the fringes of the lake. There were kayaks that we could pick up and of course, the beautiful lake beckoned as always.

We left once to stock up on grocery since there was nothing close by. On our way back, we ate at [Taco Loco](TODO), one of the restaurants recommended by our sailboat captain Miguel for amazing seafood tacos.

Taco Loco :thumbsup:

We enjoyed the water and kayaked a little towards the sunset on our first day at the villa. We had got quite good at kayaking but since the day was almost done, we did not go too far from the dock and came back soon enough

Sunset kayaking

Later that night we sat by the lake and indulged in some good wine after a dinner of instant noodles :joy:

Lights

The next morning we had planned to go kayaking at sunrise but failed to wake up for it. Parul is not really a morning person and I get tempted into staying in bed seeing her blissfully asleep :stuck_out_tongue: The entire day was spent in blissful laziness by the lake. I read, wrote and played Civ. Parul indulged in some laziness and photography.

:heart:

We kayaked again that evening. We started earlier and went all the way to the other side of the lagoon.

Pro Kayakers :v:

While the initial plan was to find a spot on the shore to relax, this turned out to be a colony of [stromatolites](TODO).

Stromatolite Colony

We got off the kayaks in the shallow waters a little away from the colonies and enjoyed the water before heading back as the sun set. It was fun and tiring.

Into the Sunset

The next morning, while Parul stay asleep, I woke up and went out as the sun rose. I pulled a kayak and got into the slightly choppy waters watching the sun rise towards the east. We were far from the city center so there was absolutely no one in the water out here. I was floating on a kayak, alone for any distance to see with land far away on every direction. Somehow, in that isolation, I felt happy and I rowed on. It was almost a kilometer to the other side of the lagoon and I rowed on till I got to the spot we had come to the previous evening and then, on impulse, I rowed on towards the Pirates Channel, which was opposite to the city. I saw a lot of grasshoppers floating dead in the lake and many which were trying to fly across to the other side. Perhaps this was a natural phenomenon but I failed to understand why the grasshoppers would do such a thing as try and fly across the lake!

The Pirates Channel was a long distance away and extremely tiring. At the channel I found more groups that had started from the town of Bacalar; some in kayaks and some in paddle-boats. I rowed on and crossed the channel with it's current helping me to the other side. It was another water body that opened up here and I decided to take a break. I pulled my kayak to the bank and walked to find a nice spot to sit in. The muddy banks reminded me of the snow treks as my foot pushed into the soft mud and I was struggling waist deep at times! Much unnecessary adventure later, I sat and watched the sun as it climbed higher and higher and heard the shouts of a group of girls trying paddle-boat yoga somewhere behind me in the channel. A couple conversed in rapid Spanish on the other side of the channel from where I sat. I decided that I was more at peace in the middle of the lagoon and head back, struggling against the current of the channel this time around. Once the channel ended, I was hot enough to appreciate a dip in the refreshing water. I relaxed in the water for a while before heading back towards the villa. I cut across the lagoon this time once the villa came into sight and while I had expected the current to be working in my favour this time, it clearly was not helping me any. Breaking now and again, I finally pulled into the dock at the villa where Parul was sitting smiling and wondering where I had been gone for five long hours while having left a message to be back after two :grimacing: But I was tired and happy and thinking that perhaps the two were deeply related for me.

Solo morning kayaking

We packed up in time for checkout and then planned to walk back the couple of kilometers to the ADO bus station but a couple leaving the villa in their car gave us a ride to the city center. They were riding around the Yucatan themselves and gave us a really nice recommendation - [El Cuyo](TODO), that we meant to but could unfortunately not follow up on.

<hr />

Taking a drop at the city center and then walking to the ADO station, we bade goodbye to Bacalar and looked forward to the upcoming destinations. Mexico had been pleasantly surprising us so far.
