The late night bus took an bee-lining route to Palenque. The direct route was one of those that were "not safe". The morning vans went there with a convoy for security. This was the darker side of Chiapas, the land of Zapatistas, the rebellious natives and the scorn for capitalism. The longer route, however, was safe and come morning, we woke up in the beautiful Palenque.

## Mayan Glory

The apartment we had booked was nice and cozy. We walked to it since a half hour walk was nothing we were averse to by now. Our host explained things to us, gave us a bunch of recommendations and left us to ourselves. It was a whole apartment with a functional kitchen, an air-conditioned bedroom and a clean bathroom. What more could a traveler want :smile:

We went to see the Palenque ruins that morning. We freshened up and then walked out of the apartment. Our host had told us where we could get a _colectivo_ for the ruins and we found one waiting there. We got in and a short ride through a beautiful road got us to the _Zona Archeologica_ TODO of Palenque.

We bought the tickets and denied the guides who were explaining the site to us. These sites would definitely make more sense with someone to explain the history of the place but we were on a budget that did not allow such luxuries. Getting a guide would have meant cutting down on a whole lot else. So we contended ourselves with admiring the beauty, making sense from the short descriptions written here and there and imagining as much as we could.
