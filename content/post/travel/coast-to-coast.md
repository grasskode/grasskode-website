Parul and I travelled to USA in the May of 2017. It was not a vacation, rather some family time coupled with remote working. I managed to see three very distinct parts of the huge country with very different weather, sceneries, people and food. Here is an attempt to document it all in a photo-blog.

## The Banks of Hudson

This was the second time I was coming to Jersey City.

</p>

Time with family was one of the major agendas of this trip. We did not have a big to-do list and the idea was to work during the daytime and spend the evenings and weekends with Di, Priyank and Ila.

</p>

My favourite part of the day was getting Ila from her school. It was a difficult task striking friendship with her. We hardly got to spend time with her when Di and Priyank got her to India. The fawning elders took the lion's share of her attention. So these school pick ups, walks to the park and racing the stroller back home, everything contributed to us spending more time with her.

We went out to do some sightseeing on the weekends and the evenings as and when our schedule permitted.

## A Veritable Gotham

After a week well spent in Jersey City, Parul and I took a flight to Chicago, where Parul's brother, Praval, was graduating from UIC. Parul's parents were there as well and we made the most of the weekend by walking around Chicago.

We went to see the sunset from **360 Chicago** which, as the name suggests, affords a beautiful 360 degree view of the city.

Parul and I went out once more to wander around the streets and identify the shooting locations from **Nolan's Batman Trilogy**.

## A Hike in Olympic

Parul stayed the rest of the week with her family and I took off to Seattle to meet Deva. The long flights made me truly realise that USA was a whole continent in itself.

</p>

Deva and Venky, another friend from college, had planned a hike in the Olympic National Park. We took off the day after I arrived in a rented car.

The drive to the National Park was along well paved green roads. Every road that we went on was well made and maintained. But somehow I found the signboards a bit superfluous. Every turn was marked with warning signs as if it was the end of the world!

We picked up information and permits from the National Park office and rented out a bear can. The threat of bears seemed real enough out here. The hiking trail was well marked and I was quite impressed with the entire way the National Parks were organised in this country. There was this real feeling of experiencing nature.

## East Coast Again

I flew back to New Jersey for another week with Salsa. Parul flew in from Chicago on the same day. It was back to the old routine of spending the days working and fetching Salsa from the school in the evening.

</p>

At the end of the week, we took a flight back to India and took another week to recover from the jet-lag. We had come back with enough memories of the country, an ability to identify skyscrapers of Manhattan and Chicago in movies, and (hopefully) a lasting friendship with Salsa. It was three weeks well spent. ✌
