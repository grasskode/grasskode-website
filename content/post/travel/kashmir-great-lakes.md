The first thing that was planned post our break from the work lives was a trek to Kashmir's Great Lakes. A trek to 11 high altitude Alpine lakes via 3 treacherous passes covering a distance of 64 kms over 7 days. While I was skeptical about how I would fare at the trek, Karan was ever hopeful that I can do it. In a way both of us were looking forward to this trek as it marked the official beginning of our travel post the joblessness. Karan had wanted to do this trek since last year and thanks to our Kashmiri friend Hazic we got in touch with a trekking group Alpine Adventurers to plan the trek for us. We were a group of eight, all aquainted to Karan in some way, which also made him the most responsible coordinator amongst our group :sunglasses:

# Introductions
Let me talk about the troop first. We were a total of 10 trekkers along with 2 coordinators, 1 guide, 5 porters and countless khacchars :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: There were Monica(Mon), Akshit and Umrao from Mindtickle, Karan's last company. Eshan, who played football with Karan was Akshit's friend; such a close one that the two have often been called by each other's name on this trek. Amit(BBC) and Kasnishk(Tyagi) were Karan's friends from Roorkee. If you don't know me yet, I am Karan's lawfully irritable wife. We were joined by Pearl and Shahdab, locals from Srinagar for the trek. Shuja and Amir were our group coordinators and Nasir was our trek guide.

# The Arrivals
The trek was to begin on 11th August. Karan and I arrived in Srinagar on the 10th along with Mon. Akshit, Umrao and Eshan had reached earlier that morning. BBC had been in Srinagar since the 8th. I was the boss lady for things in Srinagar as it was my third visit and also one of my dearest friend Hazic is a local. Hazic helped us arrange for a lovely homestay in Srinagar which was to be our assembly point on 10th. Slowly we started filling up the homestay and laughter and nonsense echoed. Tyagi was to join us by evening.

We all headed out for lunch with a hungry bunch of kids who had been waiting for us. The venue for lunch was another suggestion from Hazic, a place called [Ahdoos](https://www.zomato.com/srinagar/ahdoos-lal-chowk). The non vegetarians enjoyed a lovely plate of [Wazwaan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wazwan)(a local cuisine) and I, the only vegetarian on the trip enjoyed the other local dishes. While we were lunching, Adil and Amir of Alpine Adevnturers came to brief us up on what we were to expect. Prepped with all the details and a little last minute shopping we all headed to the homestay. Once the sun set and Tyagi settled in we decided to make a move for Dal lake and had a lazy Shikara ride after sundown :relaxed: . Dunno why we did that. We called in an early night as we were to wake up at 5 AM the next day.

# Day 1: And it begins, the test of strength
Karan made sure everyone was up and runnung by 5:30 AM, our pick ups came at 6 AM and soon we were on the way. After a bunch of delays our trek started. This is the beginning of the bonding of the kabila or as it is called in English the TRIBE.

**Source:** Naranag (2275m) </br>
**Destination:** Nundkul (3510m) </br>
**Distance:** 11 km</br>
**Map:** </br>
**Highlights** From Naranag to Nundkool one has to pass via the Butshree Pass. The journey till Butshree is a steep incline for about 3-4 kms. This was followed by a short Meadow walk to an Army camp. From where it was an incline to the edge of the camp site and a small meadow walk to the campsite thereafter..

It was day 1. First thing that happened was the segregation of the regular trekkers from the slackers. For the trekkers it was regular stuff for the slackers it was constantly saying "Let's go back" and/or "Why am I doing this?"

We were supposed to camp at this site for 2 days, the day we reached and the next day. The camp was set up in the following manner(something that will stick till the end of the trek binding everyone into a kabila):

* _Tyagi n BBC_ - The philosophical tent, the loudest and the funniest. It is this trek that helped me realise why BBC is called so.
* _Eshan, Akshit and Umrao_ - The three musketeers, the ones always fighting with BBC across the tent.
* _Monica and Pearl_ - The "right" tent
* _Shahdab_ - The lone ranger
* _Karan and I_ - The gigglers, constantly laughing on hearing the tents fight


# Day 2: The lakes far off
Day 2 was supposed to be a "rest day". We were to go to some nearby lakes. The camp was to stay put at Nundkul. We started off for the lakes and after climbing a while Akshit and I decided to stay at Gangbal while the others ascended to another freezing high altitude lake for a dip :snowflake: + :swimmer: = :snowman:

**Source** : Nundkul(3510m)</br>
**Destination:** It was rest day so we were to scout to nearby lakes Gangbal and above.</br>
**Distance:**  8-10 Kms</br>
**Map:** </br>
**Highlights** Gangabal(3572m) was 15 mins from the camp site. Post that we had to hop on boulders for the rest of the trek.

Day 1 had been taxing for most of us. We all hopped on the rocks for about 40 mins before Akshit and I decided to wait there while others moved on. We descended back to the shore of Gangabal and a spent a few hours there balancing rocks, sleeping and writing. The rest of the gang found one of the lakes(Kalesar Lake, 4000m) and had a dip in the freezing water.

I was feeling a little defeated by the idea of giving up on day 2 itself but was also glad that I was not slowing Karan down dragging myself at a glacial pace.</br>

That night back at the camp was about bonding. Karan and Tyagi had introduced the gang to the game of [Mafia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_), little did we know it will become an addiction.

# Day 3: Rain Rain go away!

**Source:** Nundkul(3510m)</br>
**Destination:** Satsar Valley(3600m)</br>
**Distance:** 7-8 Kms</br>
**Pass of the day:** Zajbal Pass(3900m)
**Map:** </br>
**Highlights**: It had started raining somewhere in the middle of the night. We woke up to heavy rains as well which forced everyone to sit in their tents. Eventually the rain stopped but a thick cover of clouds filled the valley. This meant we had to wait longer to start. We could not risk the khacchars slipping because of lack of visibility. We had been told that if the clouds lift by 10 AM we would make a move else we would be staying for another day.

Everyone was worried because we wanted to move to the next spot. It had been 2 days here already. We killed time playing Civilisation a.k.a Kabila for real, where we crowned the **King** Tyagi, the **Chief of Arms** BBC, the **Jealous brother** Eshan, the **Witch** Pearl, Mon - the **Sidekick of the jealous brother**, Akshit - The **Joker**, Karan - the **Elder** and me - the **Watcher**

Once the clouds lifted and the visibility improved we started. The route to Satsar valley comprised of ascending a stone and gravel path upto the Zajbal pass(3900m). It was a winding way up. We did a victory shoot at this pass. At the top the pass we could see many lakes - Nundkul(3510m), Gangbal(3572m) and Koullsar(3730m). I was feeling better today, the pass was doable. I think it was because of the apple we got for breakfast :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

Once the celebration was over we moved on. The descent was pleasant. BUT then we had to jump over rocks and boulders, lots of them, for over a kilometer to reach the Satsar valley camp. It was established that I DO NOT LIKE JUMPING ROCKS. At this point expressing displeasure was just broadcasting information no one cares about, not moving was not an option. A few meters from the camp site it started drizzling and everyone increased their pace as no one wanted to jump the rocks when it was raining only to slip and fall and break various parts of their bodies. It had started raining by the time we reached the camp site. It was all hands on deck to set up the tents that day since it was raining :open_hands: :tent:

'Sat' means seven and 'sar' means lakes so Satsar valley was a valley of seven lakes. Satsar Valley was supposed to be the coldest camp sites so people were either in their tents or in the dinner tent playing Mafia. It had become a big thing with the Kabila to play mafia on reaching the campsite of the day.

Oh I forgot to mention Irfan. He was the only member of the support staff who was interacting with the group, taking their requests and fulfilling them. He never said no, ever. One of the requests the group had was to have sheep for dinner. Seeing so many sheep on the way meant only one thing, eat them :sheep: + :eyes: = :meat_on_bone: Irfan went and negotiated with a shepherd, we paid for the sheep and then the gang had a hearty meal. That night Irfan and Shuja told us that if we need to use the toilets we should go in pairs as there is a bear scare. Errr. Okay. We all thought they were kidding. Then in the middle of the night, we heard a weird noise and then dogs started barking and we could hear a horse running. No one moved. No one did anything. Next morning we woke up and discussed if everyone heard the noise last night and agreed it was a bear :bear:</br>

# Day 4: The debate to move on and the secret lake

**Source:** Satsar Valley(3600m)</br>
**Destination:** Gadsar Valley(3300m)</br>
**Distance:** 7-8 kms</br>
**Map:**</br>
**Highlights** Today was supposed to be the easiest day of the trek. It was a meadow walk. So everyone was very chill and playful today. Lots of pictures were taken and lot of nonsense was created.

Once we left the camp we saw a few of the seven lakes on our way. Very soon we were welcomed by the lush green meadows. It was a cakewalk today related to what we have been through till now. We got out IDs checked one more time at the army camp one by one. After a considerable walk on the high altitude meadow, we started our descend to the gadsar valley. It was a gradual descend on sand and gravel for quite a distance. At the end of the descent we crossed a small and muddy and slippery glacier which connected the meadow to the Gadsar valley.

Once we reached the camp a debate started between the group on whether we should proceed to the Krishansar Vishansar lake. There were two parties like in any debate, one in the favour and one not. We had reached at around 1 PM and it was another "four" hours to the next lake. What we had been seeing was that after noon the weather in the passes became unpredictable, so after a lot of debate we decided to camp at the Gadsar valley and go to a nearby lake. With the help of Shuja and Aamir we reached a secluded lake or a ditch of water were we all had a swim in. The lake was baptised by the group as _B square_ a.k.a Brown and Blue. It was a very welcome change and everyone was glad we camped here.

I forgot to mention one thing. While we were leaving for _B square_ we had learnt that a few of India hikes groups(yes there were many) who were trying to reach Gadsar Valley from the other side, had to return back from the pass as it was raining. On our way back from the lake we saw multiple groups making their way to the Gadsar valley. It was too late for them to make the journey till Satsar, so it was a full house of campers at Gadsar valley that night.

As always, Tyagi and BBC were on one side of our tent and the girls to the other. The three musketeers were positioned across our tent. People were getting tangled in each other's tent ropes this day; we had bonded that well by now :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

Oh! so many things happened on this day, our dinner tent flew off in the wind, the support staff was able to recover it but apparently we lost one part and could not put it back up given the amount of wind we were in :shrug:

The photogaphy enthusiasts took shots of the milky way this night as we were blessed with clear skies after a very cloudy evening. I also learnt about shooting stars and the orbitting satellites that are visible in the night from Shuja</br>

# Day 5: Sunny day woes

**Source** Gadsar Valley(3300m)</br>
**Destination:** Krishansar Vishansar camp site(3610m)</br>
**Distance:** 10-12Km</br>
**Pass of the day:** Gadsar Pass(4175m)
**Map:**</br>
**Highlights** Today we were to cross the highest pass of the trek. It was a very sunny day with a harsh ascent, a draining combination. We saw the Gadsar lake(3586m) on our way and took a short break there. The water of the lake was not as blue as there had been a avalance recently. Once we crossed Gadsar the ascent started with the sun shining bright. The last kilometer to the top of the pass was steep incline over gravel. Everyone dragged themselves to the top somehow to get a magnificient view of Krishansar(3844m) and Vishansar(3683m) lake. These two were the last lakes of the trek and were the most beautiful ones. This answered why we were putting ourselves through so much hard work everyday. It was for nviews like these.

From the pass it was a descent to the camp site. As it was afternoon the cloud cover was back and it started drizzling. We kept walking looking for a probable camp site. We crossed Vishansar lake and kept walking. We crossed Krishansar lake and we kept walking. We walked a lot more to realise we were a good 40 mins away from the lakes. Oh well! Fuck. It was a very tiring day for everyone, the most tiring maybe. The lakes were a happy surprise but the far away camp site was a bummer.

After we reached the camp we called for another meeting. The agenda was weather we stay here another day to enjoy the most magnificient lakes of the trek so far. We would not be coming back for this. But if we stayed it meant we would be walking around 16 kms on the last day. Ascent till the last pass Nichnai and a complete descent thereafter till Sonmarg. After a lot of disucssion the majority voted for staying another day and pushing it hard on the last day. Nasir said we could make it. Since it was decided that we will be staying we all relaxed in our tents. We were to go to the lakes the next day after breakfast.

It was another night of shooting the night sky and another major bear scare. The shepherd dogs of the herd across the stream and next to us started barking like crazy. We got the same advice again. Go to the toilet tents in pairs.</br>

# Day 6: This is why we did this

**Source:** Krishansar Vishansar camp site(3610m)</br>
**Destination:** Krishansar(3844m) and Vishansar(3683m) lake</br>
**Distance:** 3km</br>
**Pass of the day:** None
**Map:**</br>
**Highlights:** Today was the day we enjoyed the lakes we had fought for so hard the night before. After a lazy breakfast, well it was rest day afterall, prepared for a swim we started moving to the lake. The first stop was to be the lake which was farther, Krishansar followed by Vishansar on our way back to the camp. It was sunny when we left which was good for a swim in the icy cold water :cold: We reached Krishansar lake in the hot sun leisurely, it was an uphill climb and noone was in a hurry really. Once at the lake we all changed and then it was a call as to who goes in first. Eventually we all went in and the first touch of water used to make everyone scream and laugh at the same time. It was FREEZING. Oh btw, Karan and I also had a float with us, this was to enable the non swimmer in me to feel a little at ease in these lakes. There was a rock close to the shore we were at. The best swimmers of the lot, Akshit, Eshan and Tyagi swam to it. While Eshan returned "I will climb every rock that comes in my way" Tyagi and Akshit climbed the rock. After fooling around for a bit we all got out and swiftly changed out of our clothes as the wind was freezing us furhter.

We had changed when a few horseriders came along with their horses. The gang went and took pictures on the horses and with the horsemen, much to the horsemen's delight. Tyagi even thought them the "Tyagi pose". After bidding farewell to the horses we started moving to the other lake. On the way we found a nice spot. Most of the folks slept here, some sketched, some photographed. All in all everyone was relaxing in their own way.

Sometime during the day we decided to move to Vishansar lake. We did not get into the water here but were sitting at the shore admiring the grandness of the lake and how blue it was. It was hard to decide which of the two lakes was better.

We were back at the camp by lunchtime. After a bowl of maggi some people retired in their tents and some played cards. Once night fell there was a bonfire. A few of us decided to stay away from it as eventually plastic was being burnt. Shuja mentioned how burning wood leads to soot which settles on glaciers and melts them. It is us, this entire global warming fuckup is just us.</br>

# Day 7 : Back to civilisation
**Source:** Krishansar Vishansar camp site(3610m)</br>
**Destination:** Sonmarg(2692m)</br>
**Distance:** 16km</br>
**Pass of the day:** Nichnai Pass(4110m)
**Map:**</br>
**Highlights:** Today was to be a long day and everyone wanted to start early. We had been told to be up by 6 AM so that we can eat and leave by 7 AM. Everyone did get up early but we did not leave before 8AM :P Noone was surprised. After breakfast, waiting to leave everyone was busy pulling each other's leg and taunting one another on their trekking style. We reached Nichnai Pass faster than expected. The incline was very gradual and we did not even feel the pain. Maybe we had all hottn used to it by now(the last day). We all celebrated at the top of the pass, we have completed the last ascent, here on it was all downhill. Some of us started snacking while some searched for phone networks to call home, the others were just happy. We were in the middle of the celebration when someone from the dhaba recommended that we should make a move as the next few kms was through a rocky path which becomes unpredictable if it rains. Clouds were setting in. He asked us where our guides were, surprisingly we couldnt locate any of them :shrug: After everyone was done snacking  we made a move, without our guides. I mean look at the confidence on Day 7. The downhill was a piece of cake, we walked merrily, taking photos, trying to get some reaction from the sheeps. We had to cross the hill as well, via a swiftly flowing stream. We got distributed in two groups looking for the best way to cross. By then Shuja and Aamir had joined us and we were no longer guide less :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

Oh btw, by now we have lost two of our members to high speed. Two of the pro trekkers Shahdab and BBC were no where to be seen. They had deserted us in the favour of their pace :shrug: Slowly and steadily we were close to the table top, which was supposed to be our last camp side had we let a day earlier. Once the short ascent for table top started, Mon and I started complaining that the last ascent was till Nichnai Pass and this was unfair :crie: Soon the trees of table top diverted our minds and we got playful. The table top was a beautiful vast green meadow. Shuja pointed to the Khajwas Glacier that was visible at a distance. He also mentioned that a lot of peaks of Sonamarg were unconquered because of the technicalities needed to do the same.

From table top it was kinda steep decline. Karan and Tyagi dashed off like two exicted boys. It is a joy to see the comfort level Karan has with such terrains. One by one, everyone descended at our own pace. It was a bitter sweet feeling to be back to civilisation. From table top one could see the Sonamarg valley, the building, the electricity poles, the highway, the traffic and the horns. While one part wanted to head back to the mountains asap the other was yearning to get back to the comfort of a warm bed and hot shower. Keeping these feelings in mind, everyone reached the assembly point. We tipped our porters and took a group photo to mark and end to the eventuful and mesmerising trek. Later Karan and I will realise how this trek will shape our opinions on any of the alpine lakes we will see over the rest of our travels. </br>
