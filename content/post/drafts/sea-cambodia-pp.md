I had decided to take up the teaching job near Saigon but an expiring visa meant that I needed to exit Vietnam and come back with a new visa. Cambodia was the closest exit and I had a Cambodian visa ready. So I decided to spend a few days in Cambodia and travel around a bit before returning and starting teaching. There are regular buses from Saigon to Phnom Penh and I took one of the many, resulting in a series of experiences that were diverse and moving.

## A Night in Saigon

I stayed up till 4 in the morning to watch Italy lose in the most pathetic penalty shoot out ever! I think people deserve better than that for their time. Anyway, I quickly packed up and checked out. A bit of walking up and down the road helped me find the cheapest price for Saigon. Weirdly the rates are not standard and every tour agent quotes a price of his own. I bought a ticket for 120 kVND, dropped my bags and then went to have some breakfast and kill time till the bus was due.

The bus was a "sleeper", in keeping with the standards of Vietnam. I made myself comfortable in my seat and dozed off as usual. By the time I woke up, the bus was rolling into **Ho Chi Minh City**. The bus made it's way to **District 1** and stopped at the bus stand there.

I got off and the first thing I did was to go back to a Burger King I had seen on the way! I ordered a Double Whopper which cost me more than two meals (not by District 1 standards though) but filled me up for the rest of the day. I am not sure whether I liked it though. I was looking for some comfort food and the burger suddenly felt alien and dry midway through. I was surprised at myself for thinking that I would have gladly traded it for a *Bun Thit Nuong*!

	<em>Double Whopper no longer cuts it!</em>
</p>

This entire area was something of a travel hub and I walked past many shops advertising buses to Phnom Penh. I was not sure whether I would go the next day or the day after so I just fished around for a good price. The prices varied from USD 10 to USD 13. I walked up to my hostel, on the "outskirts" of District 1, and checked in. The room was something of a suite converted into a dormitory by stuffing bunk beds inside it. It was pretty comfortable though and had a few long term dwellers in it that were interesting in their own sense.

There was Miguel, a Spaniard, was working as an English teacher in Saigon and liked smoking weed. He had faked his certification to get the job and offered to make a fake certificate for me as well. He had been doing it since high school, as he told me. [\m/] Then there was Tomas, a freelance consultant for Microsoft Office 360 who incessantly talked about his job and the greatness of the product he was selling. He was Vietnamese and had a thing or two to say about the Vietnamese government and the Americans. Those are the topics I am looking forward to learning about during my month long teaching stint. There was another gentleman who sold nutrition drink of some sort and kept to himself mostly.

I sat a while and then went out to figure out a bus to Phnom Penh. I walked around the bus station area and eventually took a 10 dollar bus that had a decent online review - **Phuong Heng**. Then I wandered about and came upon the famous backpacker street of Saigon (Pham Ngu Lao street) which was right behind the bus station lane. I walked down on a road full of bars and pubs playing loud music, good looking girls dressed in luring clothes inviting you for a drink or a massage, vendors selling everything from sunglasses to drugs.

	<em>Pham Ngu Lao street</em>
</p>

Throughout this journey this has been a constant source of confusion for me. I had always thought of backpackers as travellers who had strict budgets and were keen to explore. They were, in my opinion, willing to walk the extra mile to find a better bargain. I was coming to understand that either my understanding of the word was wrong or it had come to mean something else altogether. Now-a-days the word **backpacker** stood for someone :

* who was primarily young.
* who partied every night.
* who spent loads on drugs, alcohol and prostitution.
* who lived in flashy recommended lodgings (party hostel chains many a times).
* who did tours and took package trips.

While I have met a handful who were as I had imagined backpackers to be, the majority has been otherwise. With so many definitions floating around, it is difficult to categorise who is what but a backpacker definitely does not mean a budget traveller any more.

I walked past and out to the main street. I was looking for a cafe to sit and write a bit in but I could not find one of those street side cafes that I had found a profusion of in the other towns. I went into a packed coffee shop never the less. 50k for a cold Ca Phe Sua Da. The coffee was good though and I sat between loud Vietnamese kids who were enjoying their evening. Saigon seems much more advanced (or westernized) than Hanoi. I liked it though. Such joints do not necessarily mean that they are losing their culture, but rather that they are coming out of their cocoon.

I went back to the hostel and got a couple of printouts of the e-visa. Then I took a bath and went to bed after an irritating conversation with a fellow dorm-mate, the an old Thai man who was obsessed with monkeys and wanted to know if everyone shat and pissed on the streets in India. I laughed him off, probably because I did not want to acknowledge the shameful reality from the recent past. I told him, and hoped inwardly, that things were getting better.


## Crossing Borders

I woke up and checked out of the hotel. The bus was at 1 PM and I had enough time to go looking for some local food. I walked to the other side of the bus stand, following up on some vague online recommendations for local specialities. I could not find it though and settled for a plate of Com Tam before heading back to the Phuong Heng office.

When it was time for the bus, a guy walked us to the bus which stood waiting in the bus station. The seats looked comfortable and I tried sleeping as the bus moved out of Saigon. However, I had trouble falling sleeping. I guess I am not very comfortable in luxurious seats. I find it easier to crawl into a corner and doze off rather than tumble about in a huge seat.

The bus stopped a couple of hours after departing Saigon. We were at the **Bavet border crossing**. First up was the Vietnamese checkpoint. The conductor had come around earlier to collect our passports. I had an e-visa but the ones that wanted to get a visa on arrival had to cough up USD 35. The conductor, in turn, took care of the entire procedure. He handed over the stack of passports to the immigration officer inside the building and we waited till our passport was processed and then walked up to the counter, collected the passport, got it checked by the guard at the gate and sat inside the waiting bus.

	<em>Getting stamped out of Vietnam</em>
</p>

Once everyone was back, the bus moved a couple of hundred meters to the Cambodian checkpoint. Here we got off again and handed our passports to an official who momentarily compared the passport's photograph with our faces. We were made to enter and walk out of a building and then got into the bus which was once again waiting for us. There had been no luggage scan or anything of the sort; we had simply walked in and out of the building to complete a formality. There were a few people selling Cambodia currency and mobile SIM cards which I avoided due to their dubious nature. Once everyone, except the conductor, was in, the bus started again and made it's way into Cambodia. Casinos, big and small, lined the highway on either sides.

</p>

The anxious passengers started questioning the driver as to the missing passports and he told them to wait. We stopped in a couple of kilometers at an eatery. The food was over-priced and you could use your leftover dongs to pay for the meal.

I got talking to the two Israelis on the bus while we had lunch. They were Eitan and Daniel and they were not doing India unlike most of the Israelis. I suppose they were going for the unusual routine. They had completed their military service and were travelling before joining school. We ate, paid our bills and sat in the bus. The assistant was back and came around distributing the passports. We had managed to enter Cambodia without any check of any sort. Neither had we been verified against our passports nor had our luggage been scanned for what we were carrying. Eitan called this lazy rather than convenient. I could not agree more.

	<em>Stamped into Cambodia without a check</em>
</p>

We made our way into Cambodia. The first difference, as Daniel had pointed out, was that Cambodian men can grow facial hair, unlike their Vietnamese counterparts. The most obvious contrast was, however, Cambodia's poverty. The infrastructure was in a ramshackle state. The highway was good enough though and we headed to Phnom Penh with some speed. We stopped once more at a highway mart to use the toilets and buy some snacks. Within the 6 hours that the company had promised, we were inside Phnom Penh. It started raining and the traffic held us up just as we entered the city but we made it to the stop soon after.

Another obvious difference was that the Cambodian tuk-tuk drivers were better with their English and much more irritating and persistent than the Vietnamese ones. Daniel, Eitan and I set out to search for hostels. The tuk-tuks were offering to take us to the hostel area for 2 USD but we decided to walk instead. These guys liked to do it in the old fashioned way; no GPS, just a Lonely Planet guidebook and a maps.me app. I did not find it the most efficient of ways though. We wandered in the lanes and found some guesthouses offering rooms for the night or shorter periods (3/4 hours). Phnom Penh's shadier side was just getting started. It started drizzling and the guys got themselves a double room in one of the LP recommendations. It was too costly for me though and I decided to get a dorm. A short lived WiFi connection told me which direction to walk in. The street lights were not always working and the city seemed to be way too underpopulated for a capital. Things seem much more shadier than they had been in the neighbouring two countries (Thailand and Vietnam). There was garbage strewn all over the roads and the roads were downright filthy in places.

I walked 30 minutes in the dark and drizzle to get to Velcommen Backpackers by the riverside. Here I was over-quoted the price once again and when I told them that I would rather book through agoda, they brought down the rate to match the listed price. I don't know why this is so but I do not like it for sure. Do not list your place on agoda if it is economically infeasible, but stop varying your rates so! I went to the dorm room and dropped my bags. There were a few English kids sitting around. I climbed up the wobbly dorm bed and sat a while to cool down. Then I took a shower and headed out to search for some food.

**EVERY** tuk-tuk and moto driver in Phnom Penh calls out to you. And there are quite a few of them. If three of them are standing together, all three will take a shot at you one by one. It gets on your nerves after a while. I had to relearn how to rudely ignore them after the first few nos. I found an eatery a short walk away that served food and beer. Had a plate of **Lok Lak** and a glass of Anchor beer.

The prices are in dollars so that makes things a bit expensive. Cambodia was proving to be more expensive than I had thought it would be. The Cambodian **riel** is something of a change currency and most of the transactions are made in dollars. Even the ATMs out here dispense USDs.

> **Cambodia Tip #1**

> Do not exchange currency while travelling to Cambodia. Get USDs from wherever you are starting and use them in Cambodia. If you run out of cash, the ATMs in the country dispense USDs as well. The Cambodia riel is simply a change currency and will not be accepted (even for exchange) anywhere outside the country.


## Nationality Issues on a Rainy Day

I had a handful of chores the next morning. Eitan had messaged me his plans for the day but first I needed to check about my Vietnam visa. And before that, I wanted to get a Cambodian SIM card to satisfy my need for connectivity. The rates varied slightly but I finally got a SIM and mobile internet package for 5 USD. The internet here is horrible though, both WiFi and 3G. It is somewhat similar to Myanmar, only slightly better. One amusing thing that I had noticed since the previous night was people watching Indian tele-series all over the place. However, I was not shown any special love as an Indian. [:P]

I walked up to Cina Travel, one of the recommended travel agencies to get a visa processed by. Half way between explaining the rates to me, the guy asked me my nationality. To the answer that I was an Indian, he exclaimed a quiet "Oh" and removed the rate card. Then he told me that the visa processing rate would be a bit higher for me and it would be on a request basis. This meant that I had to pay more to get the visa and there was no guarantee that the visa would be granted. However, in the case that the visa was declined, I would be refunded the money I paid. I went into my WTF mode. I had just started considering that the entire Indian stigma was within the country and in my head. I sat down to evaluate my options. Applying at  the embassy directly was one possible option. But people use travel agents to make the process simpler. In case these guys were saying it would be on a request basis, it might actually be a significant task. Also, I doubted that application fees would be refunded in case I applied to the embassy. Then there was the option of flying into Vietnam and getting another visa on arrival. But this was significantly more expensive. I concluded that I would give it a shot here, and would continue with my original travel plans if the visa was declined. I was not losing out on much. I paid the required 68 USD to put in a visa request (it costed 56 USD for Europeans) for a 3 month single entry visa and hoped for the best.

I thought of going to Wat Phnom to make something of my afternoon. Turned out that I was not to see things my way this afternoon. I had barely walked a hundred meters when it started raining. I sake the shelter of a shed over a closed shop and stood trapped there for more than an hour! The rains were coming down relentlessly and the heavy wind blew the lighter drops on me. I took comfort in the fact that I was not the only one who had got caught unaware. The tuk-tuks stopped to let the sheets down on the side of their carts. The drivers got drenched to keep their passengers dry.

	<em>Monsoon showers surprising Phnom Penh</em>
</p>

I was shifting about to find a spot where the water splashing off the pavement would not get me. The rains were greeted with mixed emotions by everyone around me. Those that had been caught without preparation were cursing it and rushing away. Those who were better prepared rushed to get their rain jackets on. A few children went past on cycles, getting drenched in the rains and being ecstatic about it as only they could be. I guess they are the only ones who whole heartedly welcome the monsoons.

	<em>The rains just wouldn't stop!</em>
</p>

I tried getting out a couple of times but returned because the rains were still on. Eventually I started walking back to the hostel when it slowed to a drizzle. Even the drizzle stopped by the time I reached the hostel. I moved the poncho from the main bag to the smaller one in preparation for the next time. There were a few more people who had come into the dorm. The French-Moroccan, who had been there for some time, had got some delicious fruits from a mart nearby. He told me that they gave away fruits at discounted rates after mid-noon. The German in the bunk below me was playing guitar beautifully. I tortured myself when I came to know that he had been practicing for just 3-4 months but then I was at ease when I learnt he was a pianist. The Moroccan had been travelling for 3 years now. He stayed put in one place for 3-4 months before moving on. He was trying to learn Cambodian so that he could have a conversation with his girlfriend's parents who had left the country as refugees. The German was in Cambodia for an adventure trip with his brother. This was the end of his trip and his brother had left while he was killing days till his flight was due. He was in New Zealand before this and did not wear shoes until it was absolutely necessary.

Everyone was going to grab some dinner so I decided to join them. There were three new English people who had come in. There was another girl who looked Indian and had an Indian name (Nisha) but flatly refused a connection when I asked her if she had any. Her second name was Polish and that was the nationality she went by. I dropped the discussion seeing her unwillingness and talked to the English instead. The two guys had just spent a month in India and the girl was going there in December. On the topic of brexit, they thought it o be stupid as well. Well then, I wondered, who did find it a good idea? Anyway, since the rains had stopped I was planning to do something so decided to leave while the German and Polish took their time to eat. I paid for my food and left. The Cambodians seem less given to cheating you out of your money than the Vietnamese. That is one good thing about them at least.


## Phnom Penh!

I finally managed to reach **Wat Phnom**. The sun had set and the rain washed complex was lit up and looked extremely beautiful.

<script async defer src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"></script>

I had to pay a dollar to walk in and was not even handed a ticket in receipt. This I did not like but I tried to not let it spoil my mood. I walked around the beautiful complex. There was hardly anyone around. It was a big park preserved in much of it's natural setting with the pagoda on top of a small rocky mound in the center. The pagoda was not much to look at but was brightly lit up. There was a massive watch made on the slanting ground on the southern side which was somewhat ridiculous since one could not see the time in it, either from down below or from the top of the rock. I walked around and climbed up to the *wat*. There was a modern looking building on the western side which was very oddly not in keeping with the entire nature around. Upon going down I found a sign of "Craft and Art Center" on the main gate. It was still under construction but I thought they could have blended it much better with the setting of the pagoda.

</p>

I walked out and went to the riverside. I was supposed to meet up with Eitan and Daniel at the night market which was along the river. As I walked towards it, I came upon a dead patch. Apparently the night market is just a weekend thing. I messaged Eitan about the same and we decided to meet at the Kandal Market which was a literal stone throw away from the hostel. I walked back to the hostel to wait for a confirmation from the guys and walked out 20 minutes later supposing that they might be having getting in touch without WiFi. The market was closed but I walked around it to find some interesting food stalls. A bunch of men were sitting and drinking beers and singing songs. One of them was beating a bucket as a makeshift drum. I walked by with a smile. Daniel and Eitan were nowhere to be seen though.

</p>

I got a message from Eitan telling me there were at some **Snack Bar** and he sent me the location. It was 1.7 km away in the other side of the town. I was wondering why they did not come this side and reasoned that maybe they got lazy. Anyway, I went up to the place but did not find the bar. Turned out that the GPS had messed up! They were right next to the market, maybe a couple of hundred meters, so I walked back to where they were. Eitan bought me a beer for his fuck up though. [:P] This place was a small French owned place. The owner/bartender was a cool guy by the name of Frank. There were some regulars there and there was us. I had no idea how and why Daniel and Eitan had landed there but it did not matter. We joked around, tried learning some Khmer and drank some beers. One of the regulars bought us a round as well! It was really nice.

We left to find something to eat. We had some pork and rice at a street side place that was pretty decent. Then we walked around to find another bar. We walked up to the girlie bar area next to the river but none of it appealed to us. Daniel felt downright sad for the working girls and Eitan was playing the joker. We decided to try my hostel to see if we could hang out with some travellers but even the hostel was dead. So we went to the riverside and got a couple of beers from a bar truck (yes, there is such a thing; think food truck sans the food and with alcohol) and sat by the riverside to drink. The weather was nice and we discussed philosophy, war and politics. These guys were just 24, had been in a war and had experienced things that I could probably never imagine. They told me war was hell but I could not help but feel that a war, irrespective of the scale, should be decisive. I just felt for those who had to live day in and day out caught in a war zone with no end to their miseries.

We finished our beers and decided to check out Sharky, which has the reputation of being the longest running rock n' roll bar in Indochina. Sharky was a big establishment with only a handful of people. It was not the peak of the tourist season and there are a few bogus [reviews online](https://www.travelfish.org/board/post/cambodia/17588_beware--sharky-s-bar-in-phnom-penh-) that might have cost Sharky it's prospective customers. I find such obtuse tourists (referring to the review above) insufferable. They have a superiority complex and they have no idea how to deal with things politely.

</p>

Anyway, we played a few games of pool and drank some beers. The music was turned down but they were playing songs that I had never heard played in bars before; I mean, who the hell plays [Green Eyed Lady](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xc1PHk9FhIk)? [:D] I loved the time there and then we walked out, split up, and headed to our respective hostels.

## Coffee & Culture

I woke up a little late on the next day, mostly because of laziness. I was still sleepy though but got out of bed. The bunk bed was so wobbly that I was always afraid I was going to wake up the person below me if I moved. I walked till one of the temples nearby, marked on the map as **Wat Ounalom**. It was in the middle of a residential complex and since I was approaching it from the wrong side (as usual), I missed the entrance the first time around. The pagodas here seemed to be a part of the residential complex. You could see laundry stands sitting between the pagodas or rice strewn around for drying.

</p>

This was the annex to the main temple though. The wall that separated it from the main temple had some impressive art of "samudra manthan" and more scenes out of the Hindu mythological stories. There were statues of Vishnu, Shiva and Bramha with the omnipresent [Jayavaram VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayavarman_VII), the great Khmer king. It was interesting to see how the Hindu gods had changed in appearance out here, in the shape of their bodies and their postures and demeanour.

</p>

I walked around to the front of the temple. The level of detail in all the stone and wood works were mind blowing. I felt that the craftsmanship here was way more evolved than India or Myanmar.

A tuk-tuk driver caught sight of me and came around to joke about. He said that the women of his country would love my beard. He was funny enough, but he pestered me all the same. He wanted to take me around to some *wat* that had a lot of monkeys and bats. This is a big problem in Cambodia. The tuk-tuk and motodop drivers think that constantly courting a tourist will increase their chances of making a sales. I finding it nothing more than irritating and it tends to have the opposite effect on me. Had he just told me about it and let me think over it, I might have considered. Just because he kept at it, I grew obtuse about not wanting to take up on his offer. Anyway, I guess this problem will go away as the tourism matures. Currently there are way too many tuk-tuk drivers; comine it with the poverty and you can understand why things are the way they are. I evaded this guy by going around and exiting through the other side. Then I sat in the nearby coffee shop and had some Khmer bread, a pork bun and a glass of cold milk coffee. The coffee here wasn't half as good as the Vietnamese version!

</p>

The Royal Palace was up ahead and I walked up to it. The tuk-tuk drivers were quick to tell me that the palace and the museum were closed till post-lunch. Perhaps I would consider one of the many other options that they were providing. I used the excuse of waiting for friends to shrug them off and went to sit by the riverside.

</p>

I sat working on the daily insta update when another tuk-tuk driver came up to me and started telling me about the options I had for sightseeing. I heard him out but I really needed to get back to my work. I finally managed to push the insta post and shrugged off this tuk-tuk guy as well. But there were far too many of them. There was still time for the palace and museum to reopen and I thought I could use the time to work. But where? There was a real dearth of "sit and work" kind of places out here. I eventually decided to go to the Costa which I had initially skipped because it would be too expensive for my budget. But seeing that I was wasting my time otherwise, I walked up to it.

</p>

I ordered a large cappuccino and sat writing. An old friend had pinged and I talked to her about my travels as well. Around half past two, I shut the laptop and walked out, debating whether I wanted to go to the palace or not. I eventually decided against it and thought I would go around the palace to the **Independence Monument** and then return for the **National Museum**. I ran into Daniel and Eitan in front of the palace gate. They were going to see the silver pagoda in the palace complex and I told them I was skipping it in favour of the museum. We decided to meet up at Sharky again that night and headed our separate ways.

I walked along the road to the south of the palace. There were official looking buildings on one side and a park under construction on another. The Independence Monument and King's Statue were in the middle of a vast open space that had a paved surface and some bushes for adornment. There was no tree to break the sun's glare. There were not many people either, just me sweating buckets in the heat and a few people jogging away merrily. I walked up till the monument and took a few pictures.

</p>

I started walking back towards the museum. The museum closed at 5 PM and I wanted to get in by 4 so that I had enough time to see it at leisure. The entire area around the palace had beautiful structures which might or might not have been open for public viewing. The walk was quite nice, though the narrow roads and rowdy traffic somewhat limited the enjoyment.

I went around looking for the entrance of the museum and finally found it right next to the palace. I bought a 5 USD ticket to get in. There was supposed to be an audio guide as well as far as I remembered reading about it. But the woman at the counter denied one and I was unable to make out whether she meant there wasn't any guide or they were out of it. Anyway, the reason hardly mattered and I went in. The museum turned out to be really nice. I was glad I chose it over the palace. History and culture is my thing. The museum had some amazing art work from the Angkor period. I got to know a few things about the Khmer empire, its rise and it's outreach during it's best period. Khmer empire was heavily influenced by the Hindu culture from the immediate west. There were several statues and busts from that period which were labelled as Hindu gods and goddesses. It was interesting to see how their shapes and sizes had changed in comparison to their Indian counterparts. All the figures were more rotund and the limbs had a softer touch to them. There was always a slight belly and none of the gods, even the warriors, were fierce in their demeanour. The most fierce looking creatures were the garuda, naga, vanara and yaksha. The goddesses did not have as heavy breasts as the Indian ones and they wore more generic adornments that made it difficult to differentiate between the genders at times.

I walked at an easy pace, reading most of the descriptions and paying attention to individual articles. There was a transition to some modern art and then a short section for the post-Angkor era where the currently prevalent Theravada Buddhism was honoured. I wrapped up the sections and went into the beautiful courtyard and sat for a while till the closing bell announced the time for departure.

</p>

While I was ambling in the museum, I had received a message from Cina Travels asking me to come and collect my passport before their closing time of 5:30 PM. I walked there trying to guess whether my visa request had been successful. The suspense was short-lived though as I reached their office in just 10 minutes. I had a Vietnamese visa for 3 months. This meant that I was going to go forth with my plan to teach in the country for a month (or more). I walked back to the hostel and collected my laundry on the way. I ate another round of Khmer bread and observed how the locals ate it. It was not to be made into a sandwich as I had been doing so far!

</p>

I took a bath and sat writing in the hostel. A few new people came in; apparently French and throwing a tantrum about something or the other. I was in no mood for socializing tonight. I had enough work to keep me busy. I stepped out to grab a bite. I ate some rice and "cheese" from a street-side shop with suspect hygiene. The taste was not too great as well so I left half of it, something that I rarely do.

> **Cambodia Tip #2**

> Be specially careful about where you get your food from. The street side places are not as hygienic as Vietnam or India. Try not to get cold things from suspect places.

Eitan and Daniel were high on a happy pizza so I dropped my plan for Sharky as well. I got a bottle of beer and sat by the riverside drinking it.

</p>

The working women were hunting; I declined them. Then a man came and sat next to me and started talking. I am not sure what he wanted or if he even wanted anything, but the many references to him thinking that I had money because I was travelling made me quite uncomfortable. I shook his hand and walked away. I walked along the riverside. People were finding themselves companions for the night. I ended up in one of the more public spaces with gym machines and people jogging and working out. Some kids were playing with a chinlone and I sat to watch.

A few Cambodian youngsters were hanging out in the area and a couple was making out a little distance away. I wondered why it is that Indian society is so against love. I had been struck by a sudden epiphany on the bus from Saigon as well. For a country that is obsessed with romance and love songs, there is not much love to be seen in real life. Love before marriage is frowned upon irrespective of whether it culminates in a marriage or not. The society makes it almost impossible for lover to be together. As an unmarried couple (for we refuse to acknowledge it's existence) you cannot get an apartment to move into together. Expressing love in public places, which is the only resort left to many, draws unnecessary attention and gets you beaten up by hooligans in the name of moral policing. What a bunch of hypocrites we are!

I returned to the hostel after a while and sat down to write. I got to learn a bit more of the Polish girl's story as well. She was actually an American passport holder and had her passport stolen in Siem Reap. She was having a tough time dealing with the embassies and had to bribe policemen to get reports, something that she was clearly not used to. No wonder she was dismissive about her Asian roots because it was what was giving her the most trouble. An American passport of a non-white (yes, that's racist) is much more dangerous in the hands of miscreants, as per the US Embassy. I wished her luck and returned to my work which I did before falling asleep.


## House of Horrors

I woke up in the morning and extended my stay another day. The train runs from Friday to Sunday and I might use the day (being Thursday) to see the Genocide Museum. I asked the hostel owner about the train and he had no idea about it. He had just heard some faint news about it. The train service was **THAT** new! I decided to book a ticket just to be sure. I did not want to miss my chance of experiencing something so novel in the country just because I was lazy. So I walked to the railway station first.

	<em>Contrasting buildings in Phnom Penh</em>
</p>

I passed the Central Market on the way but did not go in. The entrance of the station was a little difficult to find and I, like I am accustomed to do, walked in through the wrong gate. A guard came running and asked me to go back but I had already spotted what looked like a reservation counter and I did not know I was coming from the wrong way. I thought that this might be some kind of trick of theirs which was aimed at discouraging people to use the railway. There are so many stories online that you never know. I insisted that I needed to go to the building but he failed to understand me. I refused to go back and then he finally pointed at another exit which was closer to the building. Okay, I would take that.

	<em>The wrong side of railway station</em>
</p>

I approached the reservation building from the correct side this time. It was obvious now that I had been coming from the wrong side but how was I to know! The reservation process itself was pretty simple. I handed 6 USD and was given a hand written ticket that was even less official looking than Myanmar's. But I knew about the recency of the service and confirmed the date and time before leaving. I walked back to the market and sat in a cafe to kill time till after the lunch hours.

The coffee was expensive but they had WiFi and I needed to work. I sat there for two hours or so and then left for the **S21 Genocide Museum**. I walked all the way, some 40 minutes or so. The sun was out and it was a little hot. I reached the museum which was bang in the middle of the residential area. I knew very little about this place, just that it used to be a high school that was converted into a torture center. The entrance fee was 3 USD and it was another 3 for the audio tour. I opted for it; this was to be my first audio tour.

I spent 3-4 hours in that horror house. The audio tour was very well done, probably a bit too well. I was moved to tears more than once. It was a sad thing that had happened and so unjust! The Khmer Rouge had ousted a supposedly American backed government in Cambodia, the Khmer Republic. Khmer Rouge was socialist in their philosophy and the people welcomed them initially. Then they started ruling by the iron fist that is typical of such forms of government. International communications were cut off and people were forced into the countryside to do agricultural work, something on which the Polpot government had based itself. A series of secret security offices were established across the country. S21 was the biggest of them and it was here that the head of prisons, Duch, operated from. The supposed "offenders" were brought to S21 to be tortured till they admitted to whatever crimes they were charged with. Angkar, the secret police, became a paranoia driven organisation which kept feeding such prisons with people who had no idea what they were being brought in for. There were mass marriages organised mostly for women to give birth to babies that Angkar could mould into future workforce. But the women were worked immediately before and after delivery and the babies usually died of malnutrition. There were pictures of prisoners that the security guards could not get rid of in the hurry that they fled. There was anguish in some eyes, horror in others, sadness in others, shock in some and some showed their resilience by smiling. It was utterly horrifying; an entire generation scarred by the madness of a few. I wondered what justice would be in such a case. I wonder if there is a justice at all for such situations and if not, then is justice simply an illusion?

> **Phnom Penh Tip #1**

> Do take the audio tour when you go to the S21 Genocide Museum. You will learn so much more about the history that needs to be remembered.

I was probably the last tourist to leave the place. I listened to all the stories in the audio guide. I had gone through all the cells and looked at most of the exhibitions. There were a few children playing football with a *chinlone* in the complex. I saw it as a representation of how the people were getting over their horrible past. Now it was just a memory for them, something that the world needed to see.

</p>

I walked back to the city and ate some fruits and fried noodles on the way. I spent the rest of the evening in the bed sorting some pictures. The German is a funny guy and it would have been nice to know him better but I was utterly bogged down by my backlog and wanted to get it done with. I watched France defeat Germany in the semifinals and cursed Euro's quality of football once again before going to bed.


## Royal Railways

I woke up and checked out. The owner joked that he thought I'd never leave, but he got quite excited when I told him that I was taking the train today. I suppose this is one of the more original experiences in Cambodia. I walked back to the cafe I had sat in yesterday and sat working on my blog. I got up to leave at 2:00 PM and walked the rest of the way till the station. The skies were overclouded but I was hopeful of making it to the station in time. The rains came down when I was just a hundred meters away. I ran the distance but still got a little soaked in the sudden heavy downpour.

I had to wait till 2:30 PM for the boarding to start. The train was a really short one. Just two coaches of which just one was partially full.

</p>

I was one of the two foreigners who were taking the train. I settled down on a seat and had it to myself. I stretched out on the seat opposite to mine since that was empty as well. The train started 3 minutes to 3 PM and went a little ahead and turned back on another track to pick a luggage carriage. Then it went ahead again.

The AC was a Panasonic cooler that was installed over the door and the attendants came in with remotes to adjust temperatures when required. There was WiFi as well though the router gave trouble and it was simply running on dongles I think. They were still figuring out stuff but the entire effort that they were putting into the re-instantiation of the passenger rail service was commendable.
