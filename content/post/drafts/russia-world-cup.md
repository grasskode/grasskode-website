While I had initially thought about attending the 2018 FIFA World Cup when Russia was announced as the host nation, a few mindless assumptions and even more stupid lack of planning had me sitting wondering why I had not signed up for the ticket sales. Fortune though, it seems, decided to take pity on me and a friend had to cancel his plans for the cup. So I happily took his tickets and with a couple of weeks to go, started arranging for the best way possible to get to Russia and the match cities.

## Unprepared
As I boarded the flight from Delhi, I vaguely breathed out a sigh of relief. The last few days had been hectic, to say the least. Arranging for travel, digging into blogs to get a slight idea of what to expect, finding possible places I could travel to while I was there, booking travel in the most budget friendly way possible, buying a ticket for Parul so that we could see a match together, wrapping up things in Pune; it all seemed to be a mad rush. And here I was now, sitting in a flight and about to enter what was to be the first legit bout of travel since I quit my job. The flight was comfortable and short enough to spend on a nap, food and a movie.

Within 6 hours of taking off from Delhi, I found myself at the Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow. I collected my luggage and then sat down to access internet and figure out the best way to spend the day in the city. I had the entire day in Moscow and an onwards train later in the afternoon. I figured that I would just walk around the city center and get a general vibe of the place. So I caught a bus from the airport that took me to the nearest metro station and thence I caught a metro to the center of the city. Nikolskaya Street was buzzing with the football fans and I did not even dare enter the crowded Red Square with my heavy backpack. I saw the Kremlin, Saint Basil's Cathedral and GUM from the outside and marvelled at the beauty of the architecture. Then I walked slowly all the way to the Kursky Station to catch my train, stopping a couple of times on the way. Once to get some delicious Georgian lunch and once more to kill time in a park.

A few things had made themselves very apparent during these first few hours in Moscow. One, it would be difficult to communicate here. Russians do not usually understand English and Russian is not a very easy language to get a hang of. I was beginning to get a sense of the Cyrillic alphabet though and that motivated me to try and learn a bit of Russian; enough to get by without looking like a complete idiot. [:P] Perhaps the only honest attempt to conversation that I had that day was with a homeless girl who came to ask me for some money for vodka. My Russian was so bad that I could not make head or tail of what she was trying to explain with much effort. Nor was I able to explain to her that I did not understand any Russian, although I guess she might have figured that out. We exchanged names somehow and she expressed an acknowledgement when she heard that I was from India. Of course she knew Shah Rukh Khan; who doesn't!

Second, there is no smiling in general to be expected on the streets of Russia. On a bright sunny day in Moscow, this was the only bummer. But I would get used to the unsmiling visages soon enough. Another thing that was very noticeable was how fashionable the people of Moscow were, at least in the parts that I was roaming. Everyone was dressed in bright summer dresses and fashionable clothes. Once again, after Taipei, I felt that I was way too shabby for the surroundings. [- _ -]


## Rustic Pleasures

After an unnecessary incident of looking for the wrong track for my train, I eventually boarded my train to Vladimir and a short 2 hour journey east of Moscow, came to the small town that forms a part of the [Golden Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Ring) in Russia. The town is a heritage town with plenty of cathedrals and beautiful view points with pleasing sceneries. My hostel was a modest one with friendly staff. However, this was a smaller town than Moscow and the language situation was much more serious out here. I barely met travelers in the hostel that spoke in English. Most of them seemed like Russians and a few seemed to be living there rather than passing by.

I did not mind too much though. I had started learning a bit of Russian and practiced it whenever I got a chance. Vladimir is a nice town to do nothing. It has lots of heritage structures - cathedrals, statues and old buildings. It even had an open area where they were airing the World Cup matches. I walked around town armed with a map and learning how to use my camera.

On the second morning after I had arrived in Vladimir, I decided to change my base to Suzdal. I had initially thought of Suzdal as a day trip only but I decided to spend some time there instead, thinking it would not be much different from Vladimir. So I caught an early bus out of town which took two odd hours or so to reach Suzdal. The bus was an interesting experience. People were standing inside the bus which was quite unexpected for me. Also in the bus were a couple from Bangalore with whom I chatted up towards the end of the bus journey. There was barely any other sound in the whole bus.

In Suzdal, I was helped by a local commuter in finding the right stop and walked a short way to the hostel. The hostel was at one far end of what seemed like the tourist center of the town. The hostel turned out to be by far the best one I have ever come across. It was in a small cabin with wooden interiors and modern facilities. There was a very homely feel to it. Vladimir, the host, was a smart and cheerful young man who helped me check-in early. I had checked in with two women who had travelled all the way from Colombia to watch their team perform in the World Cup. One was older, extremely cheerful and not too adept in English. The other was younger, spoke English well and told me that they run a restaurant in Colombia. It is a wonder how many people from different walks of life you meet on the road.

I went out of the hostel for a walk around town. Vladimir had recommended a couple of possible walking routes that I was keen on exploring. In all, the entire of Suzdal with it's various attractions could easily be covered in a few hours on foot. But I was in no rush. I had two days to spend in this town. The wooden houses lining the main street looked beautiful, much better maintained than the ones in Vladimir and even more rustic.

While I was trying to study a city map and chalk out a rough route for the day, two ladies who had been standing nearby politely asked if I needed help. This is a rare thing in Russia because for one, people usually mind their own business, and also not a lot speak English.

> **Lady One :** Where are you from?
> **Me :** India!
> **Lady One :** (referring to my sandals and drop crotch pants) Ah! Clearly!
> ***Lady Two and I laugh.***
> **Lady Two :** (who is not so good at English) Yes! Goa! Bollywood! "Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy, aaja aaja aaja!"
> ***Lady Two dances to the tune. It is my turn to be surprised and Lady One's to laugh.***

Thus was I introduced to a recurring theme in Russia. Everyone knew about India, most had been to or wanted to go to Goa and of course they loved Bollywood! I chatted with the ladies for a while and then they went to the cathedral that we were standing in front of. They also told me that a famous pianist was performing in the Kremlin grounds that evening. I made a mental note to check out the event when I passed by the Kremlin.

I walked on across the town, passing more beautiful houses, some of which had been converted into cafes. A drunk man streets crossed me on the street and shouted something in Russian that I could not understand. Both of us smiled at each other though and we knew neither meant the other ill. The market square hosted a few makeshift shops of garments and wooden products, local farmers sitting along the lane, selling fresh berries, vegetables and fruits, artists displaying their work in the garden and a beautiful cathedral in the middle of it all. I walked towards the Kremlin and came across the Bangalore couple again. I crossed the Kremlin and went to the riverside. Families were out swimming and enjoying the sunny day. I sat a while soaking in the scenery and enjoying the countryside delights.

That evening, after a failed attempt at ordering food in a local cafe (my Russian was still lacking and I was dependent on Google Translate), I headed to the Kremlin to watch the piano concert. The Kremlin grounds were abuzz with patrons and local families. My ticket probably entitled me to a seat but I did not know for sure and I simply roamed around the grounds finding a comfortable spot on the grass to rest and enjoy the music. The concert was a major local event and there were budding artists performing amazing musical feats, some as young as 8 or 9 years of age. The pianist finally took the stage and his music was quite enchanting as well. I roamed about the grounds, saw the sun setting and the fairytale-like setting of the concert light up in the darkening sky. The music progressed from classical Western to blues and I eventually left the grounds while the artists were jamming on Brubeck's "Take 5".

The next day the hostel had more guests, most of them bikers who had come in for a biking festival that was taking place in a resort nearby. This explained the profusion of superbikes and loud music I had been hearing on the streets. I talked with a few of them to the limit that either were able to understand each other. The Colombian women and the Englishman I had met on the previous day had left the hostel.

I spent the entire day walking around Suzdal, visiting more cathedrals and falling in love with the town and my camera. I practiced photography and got to know my camera a little better.


## Matchday

The next morning I thanked Vladimir for his hospitality and caught a bus back to Vladimir in time for the train onwards to Nizhny Novgorod. I was slightly disappointed at having to leave Suzdal so soon after falling in love with it, but Nizhny cheered me up to an extent. I walked all the way from the station to the hostel in Nizhny (old habit). The older part of Nizhny had a nice vibe to it. I checked into my hostel behind an Argentine group who were all wearing their country's jersey. It seemed like I was not the only one who had made the wrong prediction of Argentina topping their group.

The Argentines were in a rush to get to the *Fan Fest* to watch their team take on France. They were a bit too pushy with the receptionist who was trying to handle them as patiently as possible. Finally it was my turn to check-in and Marsha, the soft spoken girl at the reception, gave me a tour of the hostel. I followed the Argentines to the Fan Fest, this being the first time in my week long in Russia I was going to one. The Fan Fest was a crazy affair. It was a public screening of the football matches with a lot of fanfare. There were food and beer stalls all over the place and the general atmosphere was very energetic. I found myself a spot and sat down to enjoy the match while fans of either countries and a big bunch of neutrals cheered the teams on. Argentina, despite playing their best in the tournament, lost to a younger and more determined French team. Their fans left dejected as the French fans ridiculed the team's performance. This was football!

I returned to the hostel for a quick bath and found my dorm-mates in the room. There was a Mexican, Daniel, who was here to cheer his team on. He had been in Russia since the group matches and was picking up tickets on the go as his team's match venues were getting decided. I came to learn from him how that was a better way to watch a World Cup rather than pre-decide your matches. The other two guys in the room were Israelis who had 10 tickets of the next day's match for sale! I was now quite amused at the amount of time and money we had spent getting a ticket for Parul. [-_-]

I returned to the Fan Fest later that night with Daniel to watch Uruguay win against Portugal. This Cup was no longer about the greatest footballer anymore. It was about football now. Then we went to get Nizhny's best _shawarma_. I had not expected _shawarma_ in this part of the world for some reason. But it was by far the most popular street food that I had encountered in Russia. It had been difficult for me to come across "Russian cuisine" so far in the trip. There was Georgian and Uzbek cuisine at best which I had encountered. Nizhny's _shawarma_, *Shaurma na Srednom* went so far as to claim that one's visit to Nizhny is incomplete without having their _shawarma_!

The next day was spent wandering the local Armenian market and the Nizhny Kremlin with Daniel. We bought fresh fruits and talked a lot about various things. Daniel was a traveller at heart and he was telling me about the state of affair in Mexico, the rising problem of obesity and heat diseases. He also sold me South America, where he had travelled extensively, when I told him of my intentions to visit the continent. We eventually headed to the Fan Fest to watch Russia take on Spain but to my utter surprise, the Fest was so full that we were denied entry!

After trying to find a bar to watch the match, we ended up in a small beer bar quite far from the tourist center of the city. In that small place, the two of us were the only foreigners amidst a larger population of Russians. Daniel was sure that Spain would win easily while I had predicted Russian defence to be a tough nut for the Spanish.

We went to the small food joint next door to order some hot dog while we saw the second half. One of the guys came up to us and asked us where we were from. A sudden wave swept through the small restaurant once they learnt I was from India. The guy who had asked us made a _chillum_ sign and winked at me. Another girl behind him leapt in joy and I later learnt she wanted to visit India and Goa in particular. A guy came up to me later and talked to me and learning that I was from Pune, he told me that the company that he worked for had a branch there. One thing that I have learnt over my time travelling is that we, as a country, are loved by the travel community. For more reasons than one, those who have been to India or learnt about it from other travellers tend to develop a love for our country. Our passport might have many problem associated with it but this feeling of warmth that is extended to us is something quite magical.

Since it was getting late, I started walking towards the stadium when the match went into half time. I had my own match to catch next. On the banks of the Volga, I stopped in front of a restaurant packed with Russians to watch Russia defeat Spain in penalties. This is the spirit that makes the World Cup so very different from the other club tournaments. Superstars rarely matter out here. It is all about the spirit, the _jazba_!

The stadium was a different affair altogether and after so many years of watching football on television, I finally realised how these grounds were nowhere even close to how the camera lens distort them. The grounds seemed more real, the players more human. But the match in itself was rather disappointing. The only bout of thrill was the penalty shootout at the end which sent Croatia on their way to the quarter final and the Danes on their way home. The only thing I was looking forward to as I exited the stadium was the quarter-final between Croatia and Russia. Watching the home team could be real fun.

Exhausted by the day spent on foot, I spent another twenty minutes standing in the shuttle back to the tourist center. There was a Dane behind me who had spotted an Argentine in the Boca Juniors jersey and started flaunting his football knowledge despite the very apparent disinterest of the Argentine. He managed to flaunt his football knowledge for whole duration of the bus ride in a voice that was very clearly drunk on a lot of beer. I was growing more and more averse to the cult of football fans. They were definitely not my type though I did share their passion for the beautiful game. I finally reached my dorm after a tiring day and put my feet to rest.


## Layover & Travel

The next morning I caught a train back to Moscow. While I could have spent more days in Nizhny, I chose the comfort and economy (mostly economy) of the free ride to get back to Moscow. I got to Moscow by mid-day and found my way to the hostel. After the week in smaller towns and the countryside, the curt demeanour of Moscow came as a bit of shock. This was my second time in Moscow since I had come to Russia but I steered clear of all touristy activity. I was waiting to see the city with Parul who was going to join me a few days later. In the mean time, I spent my days hunting for cheap food, learning the language and trying to understand the country and it's ways. The metro stations presented a beautiful sight every time so I randomly broke my journeys to enjoy them.

An interesting incident in Moscow remains etched in my memory. While looking for a new place to try _shawarma_, my regular breakfast by now, I ended up at a cafe in a park next to the metro station close to my hostel. This was not my regular haunt and tourists being spare in this part of the town, the vendor called me inside to place the order. The owner of the cafe came up to me and started having a conversation with me using the Translate app! I was taken aback in a very pleasant way. He offered me some complimentary tea and complimented my broken Russian which encouraged me somewhat. As always, the reference to India brought up Bollywood and he mentioned the names of Shah Rukh Khan, Amitabh Bachan, Shashi Kapoor, Rishi Kapoor and more. Murad, as I learnt was the name of the cafe's owner, and I chatted till my shawarma arrived after which he left me to enjoy my breakfast in peace. As I exited the cafe, the waitress smiled and bid me "Do Svedaniya". It is episodes like these that I hunger for as a traveler.

I also checked out an anti-cafe in Moscow. It was an interesting concept that I had come across for the first time. Anti-cafes or 'time cafes' charge a user for the time they spend in the cafe and provide basic beverages and snacks as a complimentary offering. Parul and I had discussed this concept when we used to hunt for places to sit and talk back in the day when our finances were scarce. Anti-cafes have their own unique offerings to create a uniqueness in the market. Some have video games, other movies, others offer nicely done hookahs and more. I spent a lot of time in one of these cafes getting my writing done and sorting out some work I was unable to get time for in the usual travel days.

After three days in Moscow, I checked out of the hostel and headed to the railway station to catch my free ride to Adler. I met up with Jyoti at the station and we exchanged our World Cup experiences thus far. We discussed football mostly and I came to understand the Bengali love for football. He was very well versed in the Indian team's performance and I made a mental note to support local football more.

I caught the train and it turned out that I had a first class cabin all to myself! The loner in me kicked in and I pulled out my writing book and sketch book, imagining the ways I could spend the next 24 hours in solitude. I met a Malaysian over dinner in the restaurant car and the train was abuzz with football fans drinking and hooting. An Indian with the national flag had joined them and while I did consider joining them for a few beers, I decided against it and went back to my cabin, finished the book I was reading and watched a movie before dozing off. Oh sweet solitude!


## Adler

When I woke up the next morning, the train was ambling along the Black Sea and a couple of hours later stopped at the Adler railway station. I caught a bus to the guesthouse and took a nap. When I woke up, it was pouring down like crazy and I had to go get Parul from the airport. I waited a while and eventually arranged an umbrella from the guesthouse. The airport was a short walking distance from the guesthouse and I went to pick up Parul. We came back and settled into the room. Since it had been a while since the two of us had been together, the day was spent in the room mostly. We got out once to stock up on beer and have some food at the nearby _stolovya_. The stolovya was an interesting concept. Something of a canteen which had food on display that you could pick up as you passed. You were billed at the end of the line for whatever you put on your tray. It was a reminiscent of the soviet times, as I had read earlier. I had failed to find a _stolovya_ in all the towns thus far or maybe I was not looking in the right places. It was a economic way to have one's daily meal and seemed pretty authentic as well.

The next day, we had planned to go to Sochi to catch the first match at the Fan Fest. However, Sochi was not that easy to get to from Adler and the heavy breakfast and hot sun were major deterrents. In our defence, we did sit at the bus station for a while but the buses were late and we traced our way back to the room for some more time indoors. We eventually left in time to see the match. The stadium was buzzing with activity. Parul had to collect her Fan ID so we got there early. Then we spent time drinking beer, watching people turn up in huge numbers, everyone super high on energy and enthusiasm. Some random strangers got pictures clicked with us and we happily obliged. Parul got her face painted and we even got bam-bams to add to the decibel levels of the stadium. Eventually, we had to run the last few hundred meters to get to the stadium on time as the gate was *really* far off and we had spent too much time on shenanigans!

The match did not disappoint, nor did the stadium. It was by far the most exciting match I have seen. The Russian fans were jumping and shouting and creating a ruckus. The Croatian fans in their corner were being their usual self, infectious and loud. Everyone was so engrossed in the game that not even a single wave managed to cross the stadium! [:'D] We watched the whole match on our feet amidst a crowd of Russians. I found myself sympathising with the home side as the match progressed. The match was a thriller in itself. 1-1 at the end of full time and 2-2 at the end of extra time. Eventually Croatia won but Russia had certainly outdid itself.

It took an eternity to reach the shuttle buses and another one for the shuttle to reach the airport whence we walked back to the guesthouse. Somehow I found Adler to be less organised than Nizhny. In the shuttle bus, a bunch of Russian youngsters struck up a conversation with us. They were from Saint Petersburg and the girl who did most of the talking had been to India. She also knew the "Jimmy" song! After Goa, I found this song to be the most recognised aspect of India. Bappi Da was certainly a genius! [:'D]

The next morning, I had a shooting pain up my legs despite not having walked a lot. I suspected that my shoes were not properly cushioned (I confirmed this later and ditched them in Russia). While we had initially planned on spending the day hiking some places close by, we changed the plan in favour of Rosa Khutor, a ski resort town 40 kms from Adler.

We sat at a bus stop waiting for a bus when a shared taxi offered us a ride. The driver initially demanded 500 for the two of us and then 400. Since I am not very comfortable with taxis in general, we declined his offer. But the taxi driver was convinced that we should take this offer so he followed me back to the bus stand and pushed two of his fingers in front of my face saying that a bus takes 200 so 400 with him was a great deal. This entire negotiation took place without either of us understanding a word of what the other was saying. :grimace:

The taxi ride turned out to be a good deal. The roads were beautiful and there is something about the mountains that's always endearing. Rosa Khutor is just a kilometer of promenade along the river lined with cafes and hotels. It is beautiful, colourful and has a pleasant temperature, pleasing to the senses in every way. I found myself thinking that this was what Lavasa ought have been.

We enquired about possible activities and it turned out that taking the ski ropes to the peak was the most popular one. We did consider it once but the crowd at the ticket booth made us decide against it. The lakes and hikes were limited to foreigners since it was close to the national border, not that I was in a shape to hike anyway. So we decided to waste the day walking around the beautiful small town.

We got a bottle of rosé wine and sat in a cafe by the stream till the sunset. Then we watched the sun slowly disappear behind a hill, leaving an orange tint on the clouds that dotted the sky. We then dined at another cafe on some tasteless pizza and discussed a zombie apocalypse situation involving the abandoned ski ropes and the approaching darkness.

We decided to leave late in the evening. The buses were unpunctual as usual so we decided to wander on the other side of the bus stand. There we stumbled upon a square with people dancing to some live music. We would have loved to spend more time here had it been possible but for now, we had to catch a bus back to Adler and that in itself was an activity.

The next day was to be our last in Adler and we wanted to make the most of it. The train was in the evening and we wanted to spend the day at the beach. So we booked a hostel close to the beach-side of the town and shifted our luggage there. There was a whole lot of Indians there and one of the talkative ones told us about how he had recently graduated and planned to become a scuba instructor. The younger generation is so full of this sense of adventure!

The beach was nice and sunny, not something that Indians crave for. [:P] But the water was pleasant and we spent a lot of time in the sea. Parul got herself a floating donut and I practiced my swimming. It seems like I am getting better, if only in iotas. While we sat on out lounge chairs, taking a break between bouts of swimming, a Russian guy chatted us up. At the end of the conversation, he said "Welcome to Mother Russia!" in such a typical way that both of us had to control our laughs. [:D]

Finally, we wrapped up, went back to the hostel and checked out to the amazement of the receptionist and started towards the railway station. We stopped at a nice Georgian restaurant for a late and heavy lunch and then stocked up on supplies for the long train journey ahead. We reached the station well ahead of time despite a few anxious moments in between.

Once again we had a cabin all to ourselves. The train started from Adler and was to reach Moscow 34 hours later. A long journey indeed. The FIFA appointed translator who came to our cabin to give some information asked be a somewhat unsettling question. She asked me if I was not afraid of travelling on the train with such a beautiful girlfriend. Her creepy demeanour did not help as well and I started wondering if there was anything to be afraid of in Russian trains. The locking cabin doors also spoke of an unpleasant past of the railways in this part of the world.


## Yaroslavl

The 34 hours in the train passed rather uneventfully. I was a tad bit disappointed at not having seen the famous Russian train culture in lieu of sharing the cabin with denizens. The Russian countryside had offered little in terms of entertainment; it had been vast, green and monotonous. The more lands I travel, the more I marvel at the plethora of experiences India provides.

We were back in Moscow after the long train ride but it was not Moscow's turn yet. We caught another train to Yaroslavl soon after and a short 2 hour ride brought us to the capital of Russia's golden ring. We found a bus to the "old town" and thence walked to our pretty boutique hotel.

We got out to walk around the town and to find something to eat. The heritage town was concentrated in a small area which was easily walkable. We started with the cathedral right behind our hotel and walked around in whichever direction caught our whim. Everything about this town was extremely beautiful; the small roads, the cathedrals, the parks, the river bank, the colourful buildings.

We ended up in an extremely authentic place for lunch. So authentic that just the concierge spoke a bit of English and the staff had difficulty finding an English menu. We ended up ordering something with the help of the Translate App and the pictures and then waited in apprehention. Turned out that we had not done too bad. The food was quite delicious. However, I could not appreciate the caviar in the salad. My pallate is still rustic I guess. [:P] There was also a local drink that we had ordered which turned out to be heavily wasabi flavoured and extremely potent. We had a nice buzz by the time we left the restaurant and the day got even more lovelier.

In the evening, we went to a cafe nearby to watch the match over some beers and a platter of cheese! [< 3]

We spent the next morning seeing a nearby complex which had museums about Yaroslavl's history. We understood little of the history which was explained mostly in Russian. But we had quite a few interesting episodes where the staff of the exhibitions and museums were amused at two Indians walking the corridors cluelessly [:'D]. At the first exhibition the news that we were Indians travelled with us and the matronly women on duty came up to look at us curiously. In another, we were bombarded with a series of instructions in Russian before the lady looked at us and burst out laughing when she realised that we had understood nothing of it.

In one of the parks, an old man came up to us to ask us whether we needed help in understanding the map we were staring at. He started talking to us in Russian and our attempts to tell him that we did not understand his language were offhandedly shrugged off. Upon learning that we were from India, he started reminiscing about his past travels perhaps and named the neighbouring countries, cities and Bollywood actors that he knew of. He even hummed the tune of Raj Kappor's _Mera Joota Hai Japani_ with some makeshift lyrics. [:'D]

We spent more time on the banks of the river Volga, walking along the embankment. There were boats plying the river taking tourists out and back, some were set up as hotels and restaurants. A few men sat fishing as well. Volga was vast, beautiful and serene.

The two amazing days in Yaroslavl ended with us catching the wrong bus for the railway station. Thankfully we realised well in time and ran to catch the right bus. [:'D] Murphy never ceases to add adventure to our travels.


## Moscow

We were finally in Moscow, the last leg of our journey in Russia. Parul had to leave a couple of days earlier than me but we still had four days together and decided to make the most of it. As usual, we planned but never really stuck to it. :grimacing:

The first evening, after checking into the hostel and relaxing a bit, we hit the Ismaylovo Kremlin. It was a weird and colourful fort with a random assortment of architectures.

We walked about the kremlin and the adjoining flea market for a while and then went towards the city center to meet Yan. We had met Yan on one of the trips to Sri Lanka many years back. We had (mostly Parul had) getten back in touch with him when we were headed to Moscow and he told us that he was in town. So that evening, Yan, his friend Timur, Parul and I got together at Kitay Gorod and sat in a cafe to have some beers. Timur spoke little English, probably comparable to my Russian. While it had initially seemed that the evening would wrap up early, since none of us had much to talk about, it turned out to be quite eventful.

After one beer at the cafe, we raided a supermarket and sat in a park (the same one where I had spent my first morning) to drink. The park was lively with people all around and musicians putting up a show. Yan told us that drinking in public was prohibited in Russia and the rule had been relaxed specially for the World Cup. I learnt a lot of things that evening, about the unrest of Russian people and how happy or unhappy they were with the government and it's ways. Yan thought they controlled too much and saif that he liked the flexibility of Indian laws! I guess the grass is always greener on the other side.

We got more beers from a nearby pub, drank some more and laughed a lot more. Timur enhanced our Russian vocabulary with some swear words. It turned out to be an extremely good night that ended late but would have gone on still had we not had plans for the next morning. Timur's disbelief is still vivid in my memory when I told him that we would take a bus back to our hostel instead of a cab. [:'D] It really was quite late.

The next morning we woke up and rushed for the [free walking tour]() that we had booked. The spot was easy enough to find and was full of a lot of people. The entire crowd was eventually divided into groups of roughly 30 people and we were allotted to the group of Paulina (the name of our guide). The tour was quite helpful in understanding a few things about Moscow and Russian culture in general. For example, we came to know that the number and colours of the cathedral domes have a significance. Also, that the Russian schools had literature as a mandatory subject in which the students were made to read a lot of European and Russian classics. Paulina also told us about de-Stalinization and walked us through some interesting spots around the center of the city.

The next day we decided to look up some of Paulina's recommendations. Arabat Street, which she had suggested for souvenir shopping was up first and we walked down and up the entire length of the pretty street without doing much shopping.

While the initial plan was to go back to the hostel and drop our cameras before heading to the Fan Fest to watch the finals, we were delayed and decided to head to the Fan Fest directly. There was a din as soon as we entered the metro station. The Croatian fans were at it, singing all the way to the stadium and the Fest.

We somehow got to the Fan Fest in time and wasted 30 minutes or so in a line to get beer and ended up leaving without the beer since the line had barely moved in all this time. All this time and an earlier incident at a shawarma place where it took us 40 minutes to get a shawarma, had me musing at how Indians would have made a killing in such a place. We are trained to work on scale! :grimacing:

We went all the way back to watch the match on an auxiliary screen. A drunk group of Russians identified us as Indians and spent the next ten minutes professing their love for India and Goa to us!

> Russians loved India, specially Goa. Yan finally helped me understand the reason for this. Russia (at least Moscow) gets terrible weather during the winters. Goa is good weather for them and combined with the parties, a big Russian speaking community and relaxed laws, it is a better home away from home for these people.

We watched Croatia suffer a heart-breaking loss to France, specially so because they had controlled most of the game. But France were tactically stronger and immaculate in their finish. In the end, the better side had won.

We got out of Sparrow Hills as soon as the game ended and got caught in a shower right outside. It was a sudden heavy downpour and we did not have enough time to find a shelter. We stood under a flimsy cloth cover trying to protect our cameras between the two of us. The heavy rains had us drenched in the 15-20 minutes that it poured and then we finally booked our first and only cab ride in Russia. By the time we managed to communicate our location to the non-English speaking driver, the rains had let up and we raced across town to our hostel.

There was a party going on in the center of the city but we got lazy after changing out of the wet clothes, got a couple of beers from a supermarket and drank them at the hostel before calling it a night.

The next morning we packed up our partially wet clothes and moved to another hostel. I had, for some reason, completely forgotten about _agoda_ till now in the entire trip. This last hostel that we booked through _agoda_ turned out to be the best of the lot in Moscow. We quickly checked in and rested a bit before heading out for the day.

The agenda for the day was simple enough. We walked around the Red Square clicking photographs and enjoying the bright and sunny day.

Then we headed to Dr. Jhivago, one of Paulina's suggestions, for our fancy lunch of the trip. The place was beautifully done, extremely busy (we had booked the place a day in advance!) and the food was delicious. I also tried a soviet style glazed coffee which was amazingly good. A pity I never found it in any other cafe in the rest of the trip.

Post the lunch we spent some more time wandering the streets and in a huge bookshop called *Respublica*. There is something about books that eternally binds me to them. We must have spend almost two hours there browsing and buying books, CDs, pens and what not.

We came back to the city center later in the night to check out the brightly lit buildings. The Bolshoi theater, Metropol Hotel, GUM and TSUM malls were all beautifully lit up. Nikolskaya street was still abuzz with the football hangover. The Croatian fans had taken over an entire pub for themselves and were singing at the top of thieir voices. Quite a crowd had gathered around that area to partake in their infectious enthusiasm! The Red Square was off limits so we just walked around before catching the last metro back to the hostel.

The next morning Parul left for India. My flight was two days later so I spent most of my day in the Izmaylovo Kremlin yet again. The place was less crowded than before and looked more delightful. I wrapped up the pending souvenir shopping and almost bought a jacket that I did not need!

Then in the hunt for a relaxing spot, I reached the Izmaylovo Manor House. It was a beautiful and peaceful manor house that was not at all touristy. I walked around, clicked photographs, sat in the park outside, read, wrote and watched the day pass by.

That evening I gave into my Vietnamese temptation and had dinner at a Vietnamese joint next to my hostel. Jose, a Mexican American from the hostel, was there as well and we chatted during the dinner. He was telling me about the alimony laws in the USA and then we bitched about the country and it's policies in general. He sold me South America yet again and told me that if I learnt Spanish I could easily make some money on the go while travelling in South America; perhaps teach English, a possibility I had considered myself many-a-times.

The next morning I walked all the way to Gorky Park from the hostel; an idea that I had gathered while talking to an accounts teacher from New Zealand over breakfast in the hostel. I saw more of the city this way than my regular way of taking the fixed routes of trams and metros.

By the time I reached the park it had started raining. Gorky Park was much more touristy after all the parks that I had seen in the country thus far. I wandered for a bit and then when Yan pinged me to meet up, I left without a qualm.

Timur had arranged for some local alcohol for us after the conversation on the other night. While he could not make it, Yan met me to hand over the bottle of suspicious smelling alcohol. [:'D] Then he took me for a round around the neighbourhood we were in. He told me some things from back in the 90's. Then we did a quick tour of a factory complex that had been tastefully rebuilt into a new office space.

This evening progressed in much the same way as the last one that we had met. We sat to eat something in a cafe and had a few beers. The night ended in a delirium of drinking beer, discussing politics, walking, taking trams, clicking random photographs, hopping cafes and flirting with waitresses. I woke up the next morning with a heavy head and no idea of how I had crawled into my capsule bunk! :cheers:

I regained life somehow and managed to pack up and check out of the hostel. An amazing _shawarma_ had a big role to play in my recuperation. [< 3]


<hr />

I had reached Russia thoroughly unprepared, not even knowing that there would be a language problem to be faced. My itinerary was not the best one and I was attempting something of a cross between travel and football tourism.

However, now that I sat at the airport looking back on the amazing three weeks that I had spent in this beautiful country, I felt a sense of accomplishment akin to the one felt at figuring one's way around a new town. I had stuck out like a sore thumb initially, not knowing the language and with my strange attire. But given how I had stuck to local interactions and the chances I got to talk to locals like Yan, Thimo and Paulina from the tour, I had a sense of understanding these people slightly better. Their daily life; what they considered rude and what not; their mannerisms; their youth and it's unrest; the older generations and it's curiosity; the askance glances at my *fakir* looks; the smiles at my attempts to speak Russian; the drunken high-fives and the enthusiasm around the World Cup. I sat there, feeling as comfortable in this foreign land as if it had been my own.

I have always been happier travelling when I got to understand the place better and got to interact more with the denizens. It has never been just about the sights and definitely not about the parties. It has been more about finding a relaxing park or a cafe, having a meaningful conversation, making connections that are not ephemeral. And for all these one needs time. [;)]
