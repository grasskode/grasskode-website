We wrote a [book](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B0CB4NCJMV)!

This was never on the agenda. It wasn't even till the end of the road trip that the idea was suggested by Parul. We thought about it and stashed it away for another day. Then, life happened. We got busy with the trite of existence and the project lay somewhere on the shelves. But it had a tenacious grip on our subconscious. It was a difficult process - what to include and what not to, given that we already had the blogs for all the destinations; how do we make the book speak from two points of views; should it be just about the destinations or something more. It eventually took another of my infamous breaks between jobs to push the project to the finish line.

Special shout out to our friends [Nitesh](https://www.instagram.com/thatnitesh/) for helping us design the cover and Vedang for suggesting that we add a subtitle. Everyone else that we wish to thank probably has a mention in the book itself ðŸ™‚

Here are the links to the [Kindle edition](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B0CB4NCJMV) (we are still thinking about the paperback) and [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/183678813-how-s-the-road-ahead). We hope you enjoy reading it as much as we did writing it ðŸ™Œ
