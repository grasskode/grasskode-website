## Itnerary Blues & Rainy Day Football




The train halted at a stop, Krong Duon Kaev (?), after 2 hours. It was a small station and a couple of vendors were selling food here. I got off and took some pictures of the train. I also got myself some chicken and rice that I ate on the train. Pretty nice experience. The sun set was barely visible as the train was heading due west but the sky had lit up beautifully. Too bad the windows could not be opened. I had to contend myself by taking pictures through the dirty windows. The train reached Kampot 10 minutes before 7. The railway counter had told me 8 and seat61 lists the time as 8:20. I guess the timetable has not stabalized yet. I got off and there was another foreigner there. We both approached each other with the intention of sharing a tuk-tuk. But there was no tuk-tuk. This guy had lived in Kampot for a while, though he stayed in Bangkok now. He told me of an amazing place to grab drinks in Kep which I intend to check out. Clubhouse of Boathouse. Something like that. We walked a bit and he talked to some locals for moto rides. We took that instead of tuk-tuk and were at the guest house before 7 and for 2$ per person. The other guy went to the river side though and I walked into Magic Sponge.

I had made the reservation earlier that day and this was Koko's recommendation. It was a tad bit costly but I decided to give it a shot for a night at least. The owner told me they were full as I walked in. I said I had a reservation. He was in a hurry because there was to be some sort of quiz in the hostel that night. He handed me the key and told me to go upstairs and take the room right next to the wall. I did that. The dorm room was not really a dorm room. It was basically a shaded terrace with beds laid out. Proper beds and not bunk beds. I really liked it. It had a nice feel to it and the place seemed lovely. There was a weird sound though that none of the other people in the dorm knew about. A girl came in later and told me and I asked her what the sound was. It happened every couple of minutes. It was a Tokay Gecko making mating calls. :D We tried looking for it but it was hiding somewhere out of sight. Would be cool if I manage to catch sight of it though. They can be almost a foot long!

I worked some more before heading out to withdraw some money and then grabbing some dinner. I was charged 6$ as ATM withdrawal fee. I took out 490$. God knows what the conversion will be. The food options were limited since it was after 9. This town sleeps early. I found a lane which was selling smoothies and juices. There were a couple of eating options there. I sat in one and got noodle soup. The soup was good, the noodles were instant noodles. They were also selling "sweet" which was a weird mixture of sprouts and sweet stuff like jellies and son-papdi sorts. I would have tried it had I had a sweet tooth. :P Oh there was also a small weekend mela of sort that I thought I would go back to the next day. There were Bumper Cars! :D

After dinner I sat next to the river a bit. This town is nice. I can spend a few days here. But the itinerary confusion comes later. I went back to the hostel and started working on the blog again. Eitan had messaged and asked if I wanted to hang out. It was their last night in Kampot. I passed because I had changed for bed and I really wanted to finish work. I had finished uploading and editing pics by the end of the night.

9th
I slept alright I guess. I was up by 10ish and worked on the videos. I was done within the hour and after uploading them, went down to pay for two days worth of room and ate a rather expensive but well made Eggs Benedict for breakfast. This place is nice if you can afford it. I then sat for a while and wrapped up the blog post. I sent it to Parul for review. There, another one done and dusted. It felt good to be getting the better of my backlog.

I walked to the riverside and sat down there on a bench. I started off with my insta there and was half way through it when the rain picked up. I went back and sat in a cafe that looked somewhat cheap. I finished the insta over a mango smoothie and then started reading a couple of brochures about the area. Eitan and Daniel had left early this morning and I was thinking of leaving tomorrow, go to Koh Rong Samloem and then return for the Bokor mountains. But the brochure changed most of it. Kep seemed to be a really nice place with more than a drinking spot. There was a national park trail which had lizards and snakes. A national park is definitely better than an island in the rains. I went back to the hostel to think at leisure as to what my plan further would be. I did my laundry first though. I guess the water here is a little hard because it took a lot of time to get the soap off the clothes. I also scratched my finger against the shorts' zipper and the skin has peeled a little. But that was another backlog gone.

I debated over what to do for the rest of the afternoon before suddenly realising that I was behaving as if this was my one and only chance to see Cambodia. I decided to let the islands be. I would stay here and do all the spots that I wanted to do and then leave for Sihanoukville for the remaining days. Would catch a train from there to Phnom Penh and then a bus to Saigon on the 16th. Parul helped me finalize the plan the the two girls in my dorm who were taking the afternoon off helped me through it. I gave the English (?) girl on bed 6 some information about Vietnam that helped her plan her upcoming trip. The French (?) girl on bed 3 gave me some information which helped me skip the islands. Dorm room symbiosis. :D Bed 6 is also going to Vietnam on 16th I think but I did not bring up the coincidence thinking it would seem weird.

The other English girl (bed 2) who was also at Velcommen came in later. She had been to Bokor that morning and it was apparently quite an adventure with all the fog and rains. Her rearview was also smashed and she was looking for suggestions as to how to get it fixed. I don't remember her name and I think she does not remember mine. And I just realised that I am once again in a dorm where I am the only guy. :P I can get used to this. It's much better this time, none of the girls is a messy teenagers. I needed a break from the confusion and itinerary planning and went out. Discussed things over chat with Parul and finalized what I wanted to do. At least for now. At least I have some peace of mind!

I went to a spot marked as Lily Pond on the google map. It was close by and I thought I would get some photographs before going to the riverside for some food. I had not eaten since the Eggs Benedict in the morning. The pond was okay. The lotuses in the water were not the most beautiful ones that I had seen on this trip. The water was a little stale. There was one man jogging around and I think I have found my jogging spot if I am staying here for longer. The weather is nice as well so I might start now that I have no excuse left. There were a few boys playing with a football on one side. They were basically playing aerial. I asked if I could join in and they said yes. None spoke much English but we got by. Some were good, others were adorably bad. I had fun. Then more joined in and we started playing football on a limited pitch. It was paved surface though so not as enjoyable as grass. But it was football never the less! It started to drizzle and we played on. The bags were covered by a plastic sheet so I did not pay it much heed. I was having too much fun to care. We played till it was almost dark. I shook their hands and asked them if they would play the next day. They said yes and so I said I will meet them tomorrow. Two of them sat with me while I put on my shoes. THey were Pisay and Pinot (I hope). School kids. One was 15 and the other 18. Their school was on. They studied on weekdays and played on weekends. Seemed just about right.

I went to the riverside to find some food. I skipped the costlier establishments and went in one that advertised 5000 KHR Cambodian food. I ate a plate of yellow noodles with beef, a sugarcane juice and two pieces of Kachay cakes for 2$. :D The Kachay cake is something like an oily aaloo tikki with sweet and tangy sauce (like sonth). I then went to the cafe that bed 6 was raving about. They supposedly had good donuts. 1$ though. I thought I'd try. A donut and a glass of cold Vietnamese coffee costed me 2.25$. More than the dinner had cost me! The donut was nice though.

I walked back to the hostel skipping through puddles that had accumulated after the intermittent rains. It was just bed 2 in the dorm. I asked her if she managed to get the bike's mirror fixed. She had for 2$. Whether the owner would give any trouble of not was to be seen tomorrow when she went to return it. She was going to Vietnam as well. On 16th as well but I did not bring up the coincidence. Here it would seem something like stalking maybe. :P She has a thing for abandoned places and told me that she was going to see a waterpark in Hue that was abandoned. Seemed nice when I looked it up later. Maybe I should pick up some quirk to revolve my travel around. I told her about the train service. She did not know about that either even though she loved trains. B-) There was also a Ghost Tower in Bangkok which was recently shut down and I was staying right next to it in Glur! We talked about travel plans. She had no idea what to do in Vietnam. She had to go to India later in the year. I suggested she stay on in Vietnam, told her my plan to teach English.

I started writing the logs as more of the girls trickled in. I am done with this now. Another backlog done with! :D Time to celebrate. I guess I will walk to the riverside. It feels good to be on top of one's game! :D

10th
I had gone to the riverside to celebrate the end of backlogs. I sat there for quite som e time, till 11:30 and then left for the guesthouse. I came back to find that the gate was shut! I thought someone would be around but there was no one. I did a good amount of shouting "hello"s and knocking on the gate. Nothing. I tried looking around for  a way in but the walls were really tall and topped with barbed wire. Fucking hell! I even called the number available online. The phone rang inside. Nothing. After two times I gave up on that as well.

A few motorcycles came around. I thought someone else would know how to get in. One of the guys had left his bag at the reception but no one had a clue of how to get in. I thought I could get in by climbing the wall of the adjoining complex and then crossing from there. I asked the guys to watch out as I did. It took a fair amount of my training scaling walls as a kid to get in. The last jump was a little precarious since there were pots immediately under me and I jumped further and managed to pull my foot off before the ankle twisted. Phew! I checked the reception but it was locked with a sign that said to use the door upstairs for late nights. But how was someone to get in?! I told the guy that the gate was locked and he said he'd collect the bag the next day.

I went up and through the door. Found the next door leading to the staircase and was up in my dorm panting and with itching arms and legs. This was not my idea of celebrating! I slept to the sound of rain pattering against the window. Fortunately I had not been stuck out for the night. The next morning when I brought this up with the owner, he told me that i had a key for the main gate. Fuck me! The only time I decide to leave the bag in the room, I happen to need it. Anyway, I checked out and then went to the Captain Chim's Guesthouse where Eitan had told me of the 3$ dorms. It was kind of okay. There were 4 beds in a room. It was a little run down but it served the purpose. I settled in one of the beds.

I went out to eat something and found a 1$ place right next to the place I had eaten the previous night. Met a girl who was staying in Monkey Republic. They had 4$ dorms and it seemed like they were more value for money than the one I was staying in. Meh. I told her about the train to Phnom Penh which she wasn't aware of. She had booked a 7$ bus to Phnom Penh which was not really worth it. Anyway, we talked a bit over the breakfast and then went our way. It's interesting how I have lost the urge to ask for names. It does not really matter anymore. Unless I want to keep in touch and then we exchange contacts.

I had initially thought of renting out a motorbike and going to Kep maybe. Or Bokor. I thought about these options but the better part of the day was gone. It was close to 2 in the afternoon. I sat next to the riverside and then at the smoothie place and finished my insta. Then I went back to the hostel and rented out a bicycle. I decided to check out the Greenhouse place that Bed 6 had told me about.

The best bike I could find from the lot was not that good. It was supposed to be an MTB with gears but it was shit without gears. The ride through the countryside was less countryside'ish than I had expected. It was something of a major highway. Some people looked at me when they passed by. Some smiled. I smiled at everyone. A kid was not amused by my smile. :P It was an interesting ride, though tiring one since I had underestimated the distance. It was almost 8.5 kms from the hostel and the undulating roads were somewhat tiring on the gearless and airless bicycle. The last 750m or so were slushy muddy track. I got to Greenhouse and was greeted by their black dog. It was a friendly one though. The cafe was pretty amazing as well. It was right on the river. There were the platforms to go swimming underneath but I stuck up in the cafe. I drank a couple of beers, wrote, ate some delicious Fish Amok. I had a nice evening to say the least. Some people were swimming in the river but I did not. Even though I had initially planned to and was in my swimming trunks, Maybe some other time, maybe when I get more confident with fresh water. I have so many reasons to learn swimming better! The river was a little polluted though I guess all rivers will always be similar.

The ride back wasn't as hectic. Perhaps it was a little downhill, perhaps it was the two beers in me. I got tired and took a break once. I got to the town soon enough and bought a padlock to secure stuff in. My back was aching from carrying the weight of the laptop and other valuables unnecessarily. I came back to the hostel to find another guy there. He was in one of the beds that were already occupied. He slept all through the evening and the night. I did my laundry and went out for some food. Ate some Khmer bread which was done differently but was still just as nice. Then I came back to the room and worked a bit till it was time for the final match. France looked threatening and Ronaldo came off with a knee injury 25 minutes into the game. The match still went into extra time and France missed a few chances. It was a spectacular goal from Portugal that put them ahead in the second extra time and that was that. Portugal won, did to France what France had did to Germany in the semi-finals. The entire Euro had been freak football. Anyway.

11th
I woke up and started talking to the dorm mate. He had been in Kampot for quite a while but it was unclear what he was doing. I did not push the matter. All he did was sleep and go out to eat. Worked on his phone at times and that was that. Well, I did not mind.

I rented out a motorcycle, went to eat some and then rode to Bokor. After 7-10 kms on the Sihanoukville highway, there was a checkpoint where I gave 200 KHR to take the bike in. The road ahead was well made and I could see the clouds covering the mountains up ahead. I reached the patch soon enough and put my poncho on. It was raining throughout thereafter. I hit upon an abandoned house first. I went in and out. It was not as scary as I had thought it would be but it felt very weird. Mostly because there was no one around. Not inside, not outside. Had Parul been there we could have had sex anywhere. It was that empty!

After the second checkpoint that was on the top of the hill, I looked up a map and figured out what direction I needed to go in. I knew there was a church and an old casino which were the abandoned structures. The mist here was so thick that I could not see anything except the road. The next I checked the map, I had already crossed the church! I went back a hundred meters or so looking hard in the direction of where the church was supposed to be. A black silhouette was present and there and a break in the roadside suggested an entrance point. I parked the bike next to the road and went in. The church appeared out of the fog. This was a bit more scary than I had thought! The church has some idols inside and a lot of graffiti. I walked around and out. A path led forward. I followed it to what seemed like it would have been a view point on a clear day. The clouds blowing with the wind reminded me of Matheran. I was doing something similar. Walking around in white not knowing why. I came back to the scooter and headed to the old casino which was a little ahead. A parking spot alerted me of the casino and I found it to my right, another shadow in the fog. The casino was bigger and a little scarier than the church. There was absolutely no one else in the entire building when I came. I walked around on all the floors, finding ways to one place and the other. This one did not look quite as abandoned as the other buildings. The cement plastered on the walls made it feel more like a newly constructed building than an old abandoned one. I heard some sounds later and was relieved to see two people. There were more visitors but we never came face to face which was a relief. Turning around a corner to suddenly find another person might have been more scary than relieving!

I rode around a bit more. I saw a girl who looked distraught and a shell of a human being. I thing she was a real person. I went to the falls next. The mist was less thick here but the falls were disappointing. It was the top of a falls. Not the bottom. And the water was a dirty yellow-brown. Nothing very impressive. I started back after this. There were more people going up and I think an hour up was good enough to see most of the things. I was cold and wet and uncomfortable enough after the hour. I skipped the 100 farms and the lake but that was alright. Down below the mountain I was finally able to remove the poncho. I got back to the hostel and sat enjoying the warmth of the place. I stepped out again to grab a bite and then returned to the hostel. I worked a bit till Parul reached home from Delhi. Then I went off to sleep. It was pouring heavily outside.

12th
I changed the bike today because the last one was giving ignition problems. I filled up just a dollar worth of petrol this time since I wanted to go till Kep only. I had planned on doing the Kep National Park. My dormie had warned me that kep did not have much to do. It was more of a village than a city which it claimed to be. I understood what he meant when I got there. There were few people there and everything was somewhat expensive. I rode around to the beach and a little further and then came back. I was unable to figure out where the entrance of the National Park was. I had to ask around and a guy told me it was next to the Verandah Resort. Apparently the 8 kilometer trail ran all around the hill that was the National Park area. I rode till Verandah Resort and came upon the entrance. I left my bike there though I think I could have taken it in. The ticket was for a dollar and I gladly paid it.

First stop was Led Zep Cafe. I had to go to a cafe named so. It was right beside the entrance of the national park. I had some overpriced lemonade and crepe there and enjoyed the awesome view of Kep down below. It was really nice. I got a map from them and chalked out a rough route to follow. I had finished my insta while sitting there and made some edits while walking on the main trail. At the 0.8 kilometer mark there was a diverging route going up the hill and into the jungle. Then there was the main trail that would lead me to a view and a waterfall. I decided to go into the forest! It was a thicker one than I had thought and I braved some insects and spider nets. I had not thought I would hit on such a patch. But it was a genuine forest experience. KNP is known for lizards and snakes. I saw a few lizards but I was not so sure about wanting to see snakes. I would have liked to but I had no idea what snake was what and whether they were poisonous or not. Fortunately or unfortunately, I did not see any. The mosquitoes were relentless throughout. They buzzed in my ear and bit me everytime I stopped to check something or for a breather. I saw centipedes and millipedes and bugs and beetles and caterpillars with fur and butterflies. It was pretty nice. The view points were nice. The jungle was thrilling. I went to the top most point, Phnom Kep, and then decided to take the shortest route back to the main road. This was the Jungle Path which probably costed me more time and effort than the path through other spots would have. It was warned that it was a dangerous path for experienced walkers only. i took it despite my slipping shoes. The ropes laid out by the Squirrel Association (Led Zep Cafe people) helped a LOT. They had also put boards at every crossing to tell where each path led and how far the next attraction was. They had put in a lot of effort into the small jungle and made it easy and nice for the hikers. After much effort and sweating and being bit by bugs and soiling my clothes and shoes and socks, I finally reached the bottom of the jungle route. I ran into a red squirrel whose only part I could see properly was the tail. I was kind of relieved at not having found scorpions or snakes.

There was a Little Pond at the end of the trail where I sat and relaxed. Two guys on a motorbike came along. I hello'ed them and they hello'ed back. There were Justin and Jerry. French. Jerry was tripping hard and made little sense. Justin and I talked a lot. He had been to India, knew an aweful lot about Indian Mythology. He was into martial arts and wanted to go to Kerala to learn their martial art. Said that India was the source of all martial arts! I did not know that. I told him a thing or two about Hindi Mythology. He had not had that good an experience in India. Mostly because of election campaigns and being ripped off. But he was open minded enough to give it another shot. He also told me that all French were not arrogant assholes. Most of their arrogance was because they did not speak good English and did not want to seem like fools by speaking wrong. Interesting perspective. He wanted to go to Pondicherry as well. He was interested in experiencing culture properly. My kind of traveller. They smoked a couple of joints and he took an acid blot. Then they went off and we exchanged facebook contacts so that we could stay in touch. I walked on towards the main entrance along the main path. It was no longer adventurous and exciting but I saw some monkeys.  [:P]

I took the bike and went to the Crab Market. I looked around but there were no women offering to make me crabs for 5$ as Bed 6 had told. Maybe they did that earlier in the day. I skipped the grilled fish for 2$ and saw a place I would have wanted to sit in. Since the two seaside tables were occupied, I went for a ride to the other end of the town. Kep was spread out and not very populated. The sedaside road from Crab market onwards was quite beautiful. I refuelled for another 0.5$ and then went back to the Market. Stopped to click the sunset at the beach and was approached by a Cambodian who thought I looked like a European. We talked a bit and he asked me what the differences between Vietnam and Cambodia were. I did not have much favourable things to say about Cambodia. Though now I think Cambodia is more natural and cultural than Vietnam.

The seat was empty and I went inside the Democrat. 0.5$ beers. I had two. I also had crab with Kampot green pepper. Crabs are the specialty of Kep. I don't have crab eating experience or etiquette but I tried with as much sloppiness as I could. The crab was delicious! I somehow ate as much as I could. There were 2 crabs for 6$. Not bad. I got poked int he fingers by the crab "thorns" a couple of times but it was alright. I was full and exhausted by the time I was done. I might need to learn how to eat crabs. [:P]

I rode back to Kampot in the dark. I rode slow and steady and reached back in a little less than an hour. I took a bath and went to bed. I tried writing the daily logs but was too exhausted to do anything. I slept soon.
