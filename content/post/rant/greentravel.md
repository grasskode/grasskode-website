It is easy to believe that the plastic menace is an institutional thing and if the government and industry is more cognizant things will get better. I used to say that too. While a big part of it is true there is a significant role we can play to help solve the situation. But the question is what can we do in this?

  <em>The three R's</em>
</div>

Everyone has heard these three terms so often now. And almost every time this comes up it is very easy to jump to the recycle part. We obviously cannot recycle plastic at home!! Whatever plastic we use if waste management is done properly at an institutional level then it can be recycled. That is true actually. But U can REDUCE the number of plastic you use in a day. U can stop using one time plastic and find out ways to REUSE plastic trash. U are the key.

## Why should you care?

**What is the percentage of non bio degradable waste?**

About 40% of the waste we generate is non biodegradable. Of this waste about 13% is plastic. Of this plastic waste percentage about 20% gets recycled, 25% is incinerated and 55% is discarded(landfill, oceans etc.). Only 20% is recycled! The other two methods are equally harmful for us, the nature and our next generations.

**Which plastic is most dangerous?**

Single-use plastics, or disposable plastics, are used only once before they are thrown away. These items are things like plastic bags, straws, coffee stirrers and most food packaging. We produce roughly 300 million tons of plastic each year and half of it is disposable! This is the most dangerous form of plastic because it takes about 400-500 years to decompose. Anything which takes more than your lifetime to decompose and a few generations after yours is a super scary thing!

**Why should you care?**

The use of plastic is not just for you or for your future generations it is also for every other being on earth. If you are not convinced yet why you need to start reducing your plastic usage here are some heart wrenching stories:

- March 2019, Philippines. A [young whale died with 88 pounds of plastic in its stomach](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/03/whale-dies-88-pounds-plastic-philippines/). It most likely died of starvation.
- April 2019, Italy. A [pregnant whale died with 50 pounds of plastic in her stomach](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/04/dead-pregnant-whale-plastic-italy/). The vets found a dead baby whale, and nearly 50 pounds of plastic waste jammed into her belly.
- May, 2019, Japan. [Plastic bags found in dead deer at Japan park](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/plastic-bags-found-in-dead-deer-at-japan-park). A 38 Kg deer had 4.3 Kg of plastic bags and snack wrappers in its stomach.
- June, 2019, Greece. [A 5.3-meter (17-foot) young sperm whale swallowed 135 plastic items](https://wtop.com/animals-pets/2019/06/study-lethal-plastic-trash-now-common-in-greeces-whales/) weighing a total of 3.2 kilograms (7 pounds). This blocked its stomach, grossly distending it, while the animal itself was emaciated and had starved to death.

A lot of us manage our waste efficiently at home but when we travel we do not take care of these things. We obviously cannot suggest ways to solve recycling problem, we cannot as individuals. What we are sharing here is how we have managed to reduce our plastic footprint and specially how it can be done while travelling. Whether it's a day trip, a short holiday or travel over months. From the last one year of our travel here are some of the things that helped us replace some of the one time use plastic in our lives and also the things which did not work out.

## Mineral Water bottle

**Problem**

No one loves a plastic bottle covered in sand on a beach. Or on a beautiful mountain trail. Or maybe in a jungle. Basically anywhere it shouldn't be. Let's think about why this recyclable plastic bottle is there in the first place? It's probably because it never reached a recycling station. While we cannot solve that problem because clearly someone is not taking them from these beautiful places for recycling we can make sure these bottles don't need to be there at all. We can make sure, no one needs to be appointed for the job of cleaning the beaches and mountains off plastic. Blaming someone for not doing his job will not solve this issue. But what should we do? We do have to drink and carry water. So what do we do?

**Alternatives**

+ It is really very very very simple. Carry a bottle with you from home. If you are a family, carry enough, maybe a bigger decanter(if needed) which will make it easy for everyone to drink too. Refill it wherever you can, restaurant, hotel, hostel. There is no shame in asking for a refill, while some give it for free some may ask you for money.

+ If it' s out of purity of water that you buy the bottle, you have absolutely no idea where that bottle is being refilled from. Karan and I spent 2 months in Cambodia and Laos, the so called _third world countries_ on water from restaurants and hotels and we are alive and kicking. If you ask the restaurants they are more than happy to provide you with filtered water instead of a bottle. There was a time when filtered water was a problem, it's not anymore.

**Difference U can make**

Let's do a quick math. Karan and I would have used at least 4 plastic bottles of water per day. So in a month that comes out to be:

_4*30 = 120 bottles._

Adding that over 11 months:

_120*11 = 1320 bottles!_ THAT'S A LOT!

<blockquote>
1320 bottles less from any of those beautiful sites where we go to despise that one plastic bottle that is spoiling the view.
</blockquote>

  <em>Our reusable plastic bottles on the beach. A sight no one minds</em>
</div>

If you the following rules strictly then even you can be proud of these numbers yourself:

- Stop buying those one time use plastic bottles completely. Carry your own reusable bottle. And no an empty mineral water bottle is not something you should be reusing.
- Before you leave make sure you have refilled your bottles. Each person should carry their own bottle so there is no lack of water.
- If you have forgotten your water bottle at home and now you are dying of thirst, drink a juice or even better fresh coconut juice(all tropical countries are big on them). When you do this to yourself once or twice, you will never forget your bottle at home. Be hard on yourself. At one instance Karan and I had an entire dinner without water because the restaurant only served bottled water! It was our mistake we forgot our bottle.

## Shampoo sachets

**Problem**

Besides being a one time use, non recyclable plastic(which is a big thing in itself) they are nothing but a choking hazard for all those animals around you. And yes they don't really look marvelous on a beach. Or on a street you walk on. Or on a river side. They will not decompose in our lifetime and most probably not in another 3 to 4 to 5 generations after us!

**Alternatives**

- At home you can get a big bottle of shampoo. It lasts over months and any day is better than one time use plastic.
- These days there are companies that even sell shampoos in glass bottles.
- [DIY shampoos](https://soapytwist.com/diy-beauty-boxes/hydrating-shampoo-diy-beauty-box.html) are becoming a big thing these days, you can make those and then keep reusing the bottles. Once you figure out your jam you can buy the ingredients in bulk to make shampoo cheap.
- While travelling, use the bottles of shampoo. Again, they are plastic but can keep reusing this one bottle for your future travels. Use the bigger bottle to refill this one before travel.
- Get fancy, like we did. We experimented with a shampoo soap (available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.in/Earthy-Sapo-Reetha-Shampoo-Bar/dp/B06XHVZYLN))! Besides being kind to nature, it really is the best thing that happened to our hair in a long time. It is made of all the Indian goodies for hair, amla, reetha, shikakai and despite having helmets on our heads for most of the 5 months of riding that we did, our hair were super strong and lustrous. These shampoo bars are small and each bar lasted a little over 2 months. They don't really retain their original shape after one wash but what do you want to do with the shape?

  <em>Shampoo soap - Best thing ever for our hair!</em>
</div>

**Difference U can make**

Time for a quick math again. We would ideally use a sachet each to wash our hair and we wash our hair lets say 4 times a week(given the riding and the salty beach water). So in a week that comes out to be:

**2*4=8**

In a month that comes out to be:

**8*4=32**

Adding that over 11 months:

**32*11 =352**

That's 352 non recyclable, non decomposable sachets less in the world!

## Sanitary napkins

**Problem**

Let's get to the sensitive and touchy topic. I am touchy about it too. Its really about the comfort, the softness and more so if I can absolutely trust it to not overflow at all. It was 2017 when the reality of sanitary napkins in landfill finally hit me. They are one time use, non recyclable and non decomposing plastic! And just like shampoo sachets they will survive more than we would and probably more than a lot of our future generations.
Since then I have been trying to look for alternatives for the same and here are some of my findings. I have tried a lot of things here, so this is not information just based off internet research but insights based on first hand testing.

**Alternatives**

**Option 1: A menstrual cup**

_What is a menstrual cup?_

The small, flexible cup is made of silicone or latex rubber. Instead of absorbing your flow, like a tampon or pad, it catches and collects it. Tightly fold the menstrual cup and insert it like a tampon without an applicator. Your cup will spring open (you may need to rotate it first) and rest against the walls of your vagina. It forms a seal to prevent leaks. The blood then simply drips into the cup. You can empty it, wash it and then reuse it. At the end of your cycle, you can sterilize your cup in boiling water.

_Why a menstrual cup?_

It sounds scary and is a big change, it takes a lot of getting used to but once you get a hang of it life is so sorted.

 + It is one of the best things that can happen to you on a beach holiday or a pool party. You don't really need to sit out of water on your periods anymore.
 + And it has such a long life that you don't even need to think of landfill. It's perfectly safe too.
 + They can stay in for 12 hours unlike the 8 hour cycle to change sanitary napkins.
 + It's so economic. The math as compared to the supply of sanitary napkins does not even come close.

**Option 2: Bio degradable sanitary napkins**

A lot of brands of sanitary napkins promise to be bio degradable. And I have tried a lot before I found a brand which checks all boxes for me, which I have used and which I have recommended to a lot, [Carmesi](https://mycarmesi.com/). It is completely bio degradable and compostable. The bio degradation starts after a year of disposing it.

I haven't really used tampons so I don't have any useful insights on that. The two methods above are the only insights I have since these are the only two solutions I have used and researched well. There may be many more out there.

<Photo of Carmesi and the cup>

**Difference U can make**

Its math time again:

I use about 15 sanitary napkins in a month. For a year that comes out to be:

**15*12 = 180**

That's 180 sanitary napkin a year, not much of a deal but multiply that number by everyone on this planet that gets her period and that equals a substantial amount of waste. And now imagine, the cost of all these.
Replace them with one reusable menstrual cup!

## Straws

<div class="postimg vertimg">
  <a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48141365816_b5d305a675_b_c.jpg" data-toggle="lightbox">

  <em>Stop sucking</em>
</div>

**Problem**

Plastic straws are the WORST! It's again one of those one time use plastics. They take only about 200 years to decompose. And let's not forget the choking hazard. Here is why you don't need a straw:

+ If you think the glass or bottle you are drinking from is dirty then the liquid you are drinking is already inside it. You can clean the glass or bottle if you need to from the outside and drink.
+  If you use a straw because that is the only way to drink from the lid on the glass, again, you don't even need the lid! Just drink from the glass. Even the lid is made of plastic!
+ If you use a straw because it looks pretty, you are an Idiot!

**Alternatives**

We tried a few things and it will be wrong to say everything works. Here are the alternatives that worked and also those which didn't:

+ Best thing to do is make sure you tell the server beforehand that you don't need a lid and a straw. It takes a little used for doing this but it works the best. There are days when we still forget it and then feel like a complete idiot.
+ [Bamboo straws](https://www.amazon.in/s?k=bamboo+straw&i=hpc&ref=nb_sb_noss_2) don't work well when you are travelling. If you are having a milkshake or anything pulpy or sugary they need to be cleaned up, you cannot just drink it and keep the straw back in your bag. They are perfect for a house party though.
+ We have recently been told there are [steel straws](https://www.amazon.com/Vantic-Reusable-Drinking-Straws-Telescopic/dp/B07PV8FGL8/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?gclid=CjwKCAjw04vpBRB3EiwA0IiearFVfmtTGLUQO81CJ1I5fLmdqfZds2tdacccQZb30LhN6Ng7wfXZhBoCMsIQAvD_BwE&hvadid=323119574110&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9031326&hvnetw=g&hvpos=1t1&hvqmt=b&hvrand=10013679131728542809&hvtargid=kwd-425052236141&hydadcr=21438_9712219&keywords=steel+straw+and+brush&qid=1562618237&s=gateway&sr=8-2-spons&psc=1) which come with a case, so you can drink and keep you straw back in it to clean for later. This sounds good but we haven't tried them yet.
+ I have also recently found something called as [Hay straws](https://www.haystraws.com/) haven't tried them yet though.
+ Paper straws work fine. Make sure you ask beforehand about a paper straw if you absolutely need it.

There is no possible math I can do for this. So I leave it on you to think upon what difference can be made.

## Reusable Glasses

**Problem**

There can be a debate whether plastic glasses are recyclable or not but like I mentioned again that is not a problem you and I can solve. We cannot expect the restaurant we are buying a cup of coffee from to manage his waste in the interest of the planet! We are not there yet, we don't think that way yet ourselves to question them. But we can do out part.

**Alternatives**

+ Get reusable glasses. Many cafes in US actually give you a discount if you hand over your own glass to them! They look very cool too and shows you care for important things in life. [Here](https://www.amazon.in/s?k=insulated+coffee+travel+mug&crid=3SB9Y9JUVW7MS&sprefix=insulated+coffee%2Caps%2C402&ref=nb_sb_ss_i_5_16) are a few options for the same on Amazon.
+ A lot of coffee shops also sell these insulated mugs which also keep your coffee warm. So if you are a brand freak you can even get a mug to support the brand!
+ Bamboo glasses, we got ours from Ziro Music Festival and it works wonders!
+ Reusable plastic glasses, we have one of that too. We don't remember the last time we used a disposable glass for water or alcohol.

Again it is hard to put numbers on this one, but depending upon how many coffee you have in a day you can probably do some math!

<Photo of green glass and bamboo glass, ask tannu to send a pic of his bamboo glass>

## Plastic Bags

**Problem**

And in the end the biggest demon of all. That god damned one time use plastic bag! To be honest it doesn't really matter how long it takes for plastic to decompose, if it's not in your lifetime it is enough to be scared of.

When we were in the North-Eastern part of India and while buying things if we used to deny a plastic bag for taking things back the locals used to thank us! It felt heartening that they realized the horror of the bags.

**Alternatives**

The plastic bags are probably one of the problems we can solve most easily and most fashionably actually. A tote bag, it maybe cotton, jute or cane!

Advantages of a tote bag:

+ They are planet friendly. You can wash them and reuse them.
+ They are stronger than plastic bags.
+ They are extremely fashionable.
+ They are perfect souvenirs (I have 2 tote bags, after a very strict limited shopping policy during travels :stuck_out_tongue:)
+ You can finally get rid of that bag of plastic which is filled with plastic bags in your house.

<Add my pictures with the two tote bags>

Finally, coming to the point of recycling and how can we help solve that problem. Just like most of us segregate our garbage at home many of the hotels, restaurants and hostels today have segregation of the garbage as recyclable and compost. If we just keep an eye out for the same and help them manage their waste I think we would have done our part.
