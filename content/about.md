## The Blog

This is the second attempt to maintain a blog of my own. Once upon a time I had taken a domain and hosted a wordpress powered website. Then I gave up because I did not really think I had stories to tell. This time around, I think I do have stories to tell. Maybe this one will survive.

The blog will mostly contain a more regular log of my travels and activities. Otherwise I am active on [medium](http://medium.com/@grasskode), [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/grasskode) and [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/grasskode/). I used to blog on [blogger](http://fleetingnonsense.blogspot.in/) and write my book reviews [here](http://bookedvorm.blogspot.in/). Yup, I have created a big mess all over the internet!

## Me

I have always struggled with this section. From the days when social media was gaining popularity in India and people were creating their profiles in various sites, this was the only question I never had a straight answer for :

> Write a few lines about yourself.

I am what I do and this entire blog is perhaps an attempt to answer that very question. There are a few things that interest me and a man's interest are what define him, I guess.

- **Technology** : It is my bread and butter after all!
- **Reading**    : I am usually to be found with a book. I have found the most enduring and loyal friends in the pedigree.
- **Writing**    : I aspire to write something of consequence. Someday.
- **Fl√¢nerie**   : I love strolling the streets and back alleys of a city. If you look closely, there are things waiting to tell their stories.
- **Outdoors**   : They have been my passion for quite some time now.
- **Music**      : **BIG** fan of rock n' roll! Though I listen to anything and everything.
- **Travel**     : But then that is the fad of the age...
